                "content": "Origin stories can be hit (\"Wicked\" the musical) or miss (who even remembers \"Oz the Great and Powerful\"?). On that scale \"Wonka\" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame \"Wonka\". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of \"The French Dispatch\" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe \"Wonka\"."

                "content": "Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good? This movie will surely entice the youngsters whom ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well. Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get excited about it either unfortunately..."

                "content": "Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."

Charlie and the Chocolate factory was my favourite book in my childhood, I watched both movies many times and my kids took that passion from me and my wife. We were looking forward to see Wonka, but then we were all disappointed.Movies is not bad, it's fairly entertaining, kids liked it, but we all agreed it's nowhere close to Tim Burton's movie. There was huge potential to bring some new magic into the chocolate world of Willy Wonka, but they failed to do that.During the movie, I never once felt the irresistible craving for chocolate, even though I'm a big fan of sweets. That's an unforgivable mistake. In Burton's film, I enjoyed the world of chocolate, from the beginning until the end. Also, the story is very average, focused mainly on the negative aspects of the world we live in. I don't know if they wanted to make a chocolate Oliver Twist, but the combination of the magical world of chocolate and the harsh realism of Charles Dickens just doesn't work together. I'm not dissatisfied with the film, but I am disappointed because it could and should have been much better, more magical, more appealing, and - tastier."

This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timothée Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."

                "content": "On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timothée Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."

That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."

With the most unique recipes, he quickly establishes himself as the best chocolate maker which irks the trio of the chocolate cartel. They want him gone in order to have their monopoly. How Wonka finds his unlikely family in London, who support him to make his dream turn into reality as well as take on the trio of villains forms rest of the story.This musical aims to establish this as a sweet film right with Wonka's introduction in the opening credits and it succeeds in that. Atleast 3 songs stood out and the back story to Noodles provide the much needed drama. There is also Wonka's bonding with his own mother. The songs compliment these emotions as well as the wacky ambition of the young chocolate maker. With the likes of Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Keegan-Michael Key in the supporting cast, makes it even easier in keeping the entertainment intact.The humor worked for me throughout and Timothee Chalamet brought some freshness with his take on the titular character. Calah Lane as Noodles was another standout character. The songs keep entertaining and so does the comedy scenes followed enough dose of drama without dragging the story. Ofcourse adult Wonka turned out to be quiet different and this film doesn't try to reveal anything about that, presenting Wonka as this sweetest boy learning to value relationship and succeeding in his dream to open a chocolate shop. It's a screenplay of convenience and there isn't much to complain."

The production level is excellent, the costume design manages to be fun and the performances are good, especially that of Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka, in addition to a successful special performance by Sally Hawkins. The musical numbers are well choreographed and managed to be performed by the voices of the entire cast. One negative thing to highlight are the digital special effects that look fake in every scene in which they are added. The editing work is of a good level. The music composed for the film has potential and is enjoyable. \"Wonka\" shines as a great movie for the Christmas season."

Paddington 1 &2 are some of the best family films ever made and their charm makes them a great watch every time. Wonka now joins that list.First off, the production design is spectacular. It really is pure imagination. The costumes, set pieces, songs and casting were all fantastic. The pacing was spot on and no time did I feel bored or that it dragged.Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa was brilliant but for me Timothee Chalamet stole the show. His singing and acting was fantastic and really immersed you in the Wonka story.2023 has been a fantastic year for film and Wonka rounds off the year perfectly. A must watch!"

                "content": "Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That \"edge\" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's \"Pure Imagination,\" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."

The story was not interesting, by making Wonka kind of secret in the original is what made it magical and interesting, Willy Wonka didn't need any back story.The songs weren't as good as they were in the original they seemed plain and unthoughtful.The giraffe milk was odd bd stupid.The cast was ok I guess, a few familiar faces, Roman Atkinson and Matt Lucas, was nice to see them on screen I guess, but apart from that this prequel was nothing special and it definitely wasn't needed.Take my advise avoiddddd."

                "content": "Wonka (2023) : Movie Review -Wonka Review: So you must have read Roal Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964); you must have seen Gene Wilder's blockbuster \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971) and then Tom Burton-Johnny Depp's mega hit \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005), so now it's time for Timothée Chalamet's origin story of Willy Wonka with \"Wonka\" (2023). It's been almost seven decades, and the tale hasn't lost a bit of its magic. It's so enchanting, joyful, and colourful that all you need to do is handle it with your good skills. That's it. You have success in your hands because the source material is just too good. Comedy lover Paul King gets it right. Paul understood the assignment well. Wonka is an exhilarant, amusing, extremely engaging, musically vibrant, and full of chocolate entertainer that stays true to its origin and gives it a nice modern touch as well.Wonka is like a prequel to what you have seen in Wilder and Depp's movies. There you have a chocolate factory, and here the story takes you to the backstory before the factory was built. Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) is a youngster with the talent to make incredible chocolates. He isn't settled yet, though. Rather, he hasn't started his career. He keeps wandering the streets and halls and showcasing his talent for making chocolate that can instantly win people's tongues and stomachs. Since he is selling chocolates at cheap rates that even \"poor\" people can afford, the competitors sense the danger. They try their best to keep him out of the business in whatever way possible, and most of the time they succeed. Amidst his ambition of becoming a great chocolate maker, Wonka is scammed by a small hotel owner and is made her servant for years to come. With the help of Noodle/Nicole (Calah Lane) and other imprisoners, Wonka must find a way out and also set his business against the corrupt chocolate businessmen.First of all, Paul King has written a king-size entertainer for all age groups. The humour is organic, the gags are real, and the magical touch of Wonka's fantasy world makes this one very interesting and engaging. The musical numbers are also well written, as the lyrics have meaning to keep the mood going. Wonka's origin story is not old or outdated; rather, it's completely unknown for many, and that's why there are so many pleasant surprises in the movie. In the end, we see Wonka building the factory, which we all know, and you can connect dots very well there. We are short on good musical comedies nowadays, and thanks to Paul King for writing one that lives up to expectations. We had children, young males and females, and adults in our special show, and the comical segment had us all in splits at the time. I think that's just dandy. I was craving; I was drooling for chocolates by the end, and I wish I could enter the screen just like Mia Farrow did it in Woody Allen's \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" (1985) and devour the mashmello and all the flavours. It's so freaking tasty.Timothée Chalamet is fantastic as Wonka. I wouldn't dare compare this young lad with legends like Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder, but yes, he is our Willy Wonka, alright. If those generations remember Wilder and Depp at that time, then let this social media generation remember Chalamet. Calah Lane is a sweet child with some adorable scenes, and she looks so cute in all of them. Paterson Joseph is not the deadly, cruel, but funnily cruel villain here that one would expect in a chocolate-comedy flick like this. There is something about his character that we miss in so many other musical comedies. Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton (that yuk \"poor\" joke was so rich) support him well. Keegan-Michael Key's transformation had the audience on a roll by the end. Our favourite Mr. Bean, Rowan Atkinson, is a desperate chocoholic, but who must have thought about giving his character the reference of a priest? I mean, it's so hilarious to know. The first frame of his had the audience hooting, and we all really wanted him to have more screen space. Jim Carter, Tom Davis, Olivia Colman, Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins, Natasha Rothwell, Rakhee Thakrar, Rich Fulcher, and others were fine in their supporting roles.Joby Talbot's songs have made Wonka extra delicious, and one can even go on tapping their feet in the cinema hall without even realising when that process begins, automatically. I was tapping my feet, and I didn't even realise it. Mark Everson's editing has literally no flaws. The only scene that looked slow and dated was when Noodle finds her mother, and then you have to think again to know how important that scene was for the film. Chung-hoon Chung's camera gives you some yummy frames of chocolate and whatnot. Roald Dahl's classic character needed a modern restoration on celluloid, and Paul King has given us that. Action, music, comedy, a little bit of a thrill, and an overflow of chocolates-that's what Paul serves you on the table in no time. Scrumptious is the word! \"You've never tasted chocolate like this,\" says Wonka in one of the songs, and I can assure you that he really meant it. This chocoholic musical melody deserves to be swallowed with tasty rashes on your tongue. There is no need to go to any chocolate shop; just visit the nearest cinema hall.RATING - 6/10*"

Definitely.Do musicals recall you good old times with your acquaIntances? Absolutely.Ladies and gentlemen, that's 'Wonka'! A brilliant movie filled with magic. Chalamet delivers a wonderful performance, whose range of acting hugely widens with this role, from a 1920s clown like Chaplin to a 1950s charming dancer like Gene Kelly.I was especially delighted with the city's atmosphere, it's a Victorian London-like city. It's clear that Paul King knows how to bottle Christmas essence, mixing grayish pedestrian streets and brick buildings with goldish open malls. Watching this movie takes you back to the time when you were a child, and you walked hand in hand with your parents watching extravagant shopwindows displaying the finest products on Christmas.And what about the music? It's perfect! 'Oompah Loompah doompety do' won't get out of your head besides the fancy choreographies, every detail and nuance conveys a Christmas ambience. You can even taste the chocolate, slip with the iced flor covered in snow, smell the chestnuts, notice the smoke from the chimneys... Finally, we're not even un mid-December ans \"it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\" so please get yourself a hot chocolate mug get together with family and enjoy watching 'Wonka' because it will become a Christmas classic."

Despite the commendable efforts of a talented cast, they struggle against a script that is both boring and predictable. Their performance, while earnest, cannot elevate the lackluster storyline.The music, often a redeeming feature in such films, sadly fails to deliver. It doesn't capture the audience's interest or invite participation. There's a noticeable lack of catchy tunes or engaging rhythms, making the musical aspect forgettable.Targeted at families, the film surprisingly doesn't resonate with children. The humor is limited and mostly revealed in the trailers, leaving little to be discovered in the theater. The sporadic laughs from the younger viewers are few and far between, indicating the film's failure to connect with its intended audience.A key element missing is the enchanting and quirky charm typically associated with \"Wonka movies.\" This film follows a too straightforward and mundane path, lacking the vibrancy and uniqueness that made previous films stand out. Overall, it's a disappointing experience that lacks the magic and personality needed to make it memorable."

Director Paul King, known for his works on Paddington 1 and 2, does a solid role in handling the setting and themes. The production, color presentations, and the sound designs are great with some good visuals effects and style. All the performances are pretty good as Timothée Chalamet, Calah Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Grant and the rest of the cast members are all fun to observe. Rowan Atkinson is always a blast to see.The narrative is standard and King does try to provide some new interesting elements and style to the story and characters and there are some concepts that worked and some that could have been better. On the humor and singing, there are some good singing moments from the cast members and the humor was solid, although some humorous moments felt flat. The character of Willy Wonka is fun to observe but the other characters weren't really that investing or emotionally engaging to connect with. Some dialogue moments could be better.While it's not amazing, the pacing was good and I was still invested to see where the movie was heading.

Give the Oscars to them both already.The production design and art direction provide a dazzling visual feast, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.For better or worse, Willy Wonka here is presented as sweet and warm and lovable although we know him as a much darker personality as played by Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in the films based on Roald Dahl's book. This is the back story, so I guess he started off more innocently. But I still can't get over Timothee Chalamet's absolutely flawless performance.

I maybe gave a little smile at 1 or 2 moments but that is all, which makes this film a failure as a comedy movie. The older Wonka films had much better humour and far better acting, therefore resulting in a much more enjoyable experience.The music is also distractingly irritating, and is certain to break windows.

Viewers learn the origin story of the eccentric chocolatier and magician.Willy (Timothée Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the Gallery Gourmet but quickly runs out of money. He meets Bleacher (Tom Davis), who introduces Willy to Mrs. Scrubbitt (Olivia Colman), who tricks him into a contract and forces him to work in her laundry room to pay off his debt. There he meets other indentured workers - Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar) and Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Noodle (Calah Lane) becomes Willy's closest ally and joins him to defeat the corrupt Chocolate Cartel and reach his goal of opening a chocolate shop.I never expected to feel so many emotions in a Willy Wonka movie. There is the familiar magicalness of Willy who whips up the most amazing chocolate and candy confections, like Hoverchocs that can make you fly. Yet the performances, musical score and art direction really pulled me into the story. The song, \"Pure Imagination,\" appears in different versions throughout the film and adds to the emotional experience. I really like the character development and the sibling-like friendship between Willy and Noodle. When Willy agrees to secretly leave town to free his friends, Timothée Chalamet's singing of \"Sorry Noodle\" had me crying my eyes out. The evilness of the Chocolate Cartel led by Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph) had me so angry as they repeatedly try to defeat Willy and they eventually trap Willy and Noodle. My favorite part is when the Oompa Loompa Lofty (Hugh Grant) saves Willy and Noodle from being drowned in chocolate.The message of Wonka is to let your imagination run wild and keep striving for your dreams even when the odds are stacked against you. In the end, the struggle will be worth it, especially if you have friends to share your success with.I give Wonka 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The film will be released in theaters on December 15, 2023. By Kira O., KIDS FIRST!"

I was simply blown away by so many amazing original songs and performances, and there was a good balance of comedy and drama that would appeal to the whole family.Having only seen a movie poster of Wonka, I did not have much to go on. I did not even know it was a musical until the movie started, and then, I was engaged from beginning to end.From the playful glint in his eyes to his quirky smiles and cane-twirling sequences, Timothee Chalamet's whimsical performance gives nods to both Johnny Depp's and Gene Wilder's earlier depictions of Wonka, while still adding his own spin and spice (and all things nice) to the young Wonka he plays.There is a purity and crispness in Chalamet's delivery of both script and song that encapsulates that sense of wonder a young Willy Wonka manages to hold on to through the formative years of his youth, despite all the setbacks and hardships that befalls him. And this is key because it carries over into his later years, and it is the re-imagining through this lens of childlike innocence that inspires audiences around the world to have hope and dare to dream again.Special mention to Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa, who delivers his lines in perfect matter-of-fact British fashion. My niece liked his performance so much, she was singing Oompa Loompa all the way home, while I tried to sway her to sing Pure Imagination instead.If there is one movie to catch this Christmas with your loved ones, this should be it! And would I watch it again? Oh, ABSOLUTELY!"

It's very well made, it's well acted, all that's missing is the magic.I know I shouldn't be comparing it to the past, it's better than the Depp movie, but not a patch on Wilder's."

Director Takashi Yamazaki's Herculean efforts of reviving the Kaiju franchise is effortlessly awesome and absolutely top-tier filmmaking with the origin story of the gigantic monster showing up off the shores of post WWII Japan as it engages a full-tilt invasion of Tokyo and its environs with atypical destruction and death. Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic). One of the year's best films."

The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That's the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don't want to say too much, it's best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren't perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5My current Godzilla rankings:1) Gojira (1954) 2) Godzilla Minus One (2023) 3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995) 4) Shin Godzilla (2016) 5) Return of Godzilla (1984)Special mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)"

Holy heaven, I was so surprised by GODZILLA MINUS ONE. In a year where both of my most anticipated movies turned out to be crummy disappointments (BARBIE and NAPOLEON), this movie-- a film I had no initial plans of seeing and had little enthusiasm for going into it-- blew me away.Godzilla is actually terrifying in this. The post-WWII setting was well-realized, with the characters exhausted after years of violence, destruction, and struggle. The characters were all relatable and interesting-- unlike other Godzilla movies I've seen, I cared intensely about their fates and was emotionally invested in the little found family they formed. And thank God for the lack of ironic jokes undercutting emotional scenes-- after so many trash Hollywood movies, I didn't even know it was possible for a blockbuster to be sincere like this anymore.Most of all, I love how life-affirming this film is. The cautious but persistent optimism is such a breath of fresh air. About my only criticism is that the ending twist is a little hokey... but to be honest, I can forgive that. The movie is too good for me to complain about a happy ending."

Special effects are superior and well presented.The film sucks you into a vortex of history, monsters, and surprisingly restores your faith in humanity. It makes you fall in love with the characters.Then with perfect timing, reflects the singular and exquisite quality of the Japanese people; their acute sense of the cost of war and their abiding commitment to the future.Because of that, there is nothing in this film that I can criticize."

Well, until she suddenly turns out to be alive at the end, in order to allow a happy ending. Kind of ruined the meaning of the death for the main character and emotion part (as the title \"Minus One\" can have a meaning for Japan overall AND specificaly the main hero).The idea to set the story in the 40's Japan is also interesting, as a foreigner i really discovered this post-war period of the country that i didn't really know about (i only saw Kurosawa's \"Subarashiki nichiyobi\" prior to this movie).The actions sequences are also very cool. You definitively won't be disapointed with them. I loved the treatment of the King of the Monsters, who have an interesting design and new ability (both are kind of linked).I saw it in a casual cinema, but i guess the IMAX version is worth it, so go for it if you got the chance."

                "content": "LIKES:The Story: -You might not care if there is a plot for a monster movie, but in this film the plot actually holds more soul than the ones from most monster-verse flicks.-Centered on a good character with lots of struggles, Yamazaki has blended cultural traditions with an engaging character and given me a human I like.-Godzilla may be the namesake, but Shikishima is a great character whose story mirrors the further revelation of the beast. And I really enjoyed this gradual evolution of plot and character development.-The evolution of handling Godzilla felt like Jaws almost, gradually pushing to an epic finale that feels climactic and in character with the film.The Writing: -It's not the most unique or amazing writing, but again, it's real, raw, and fitting for the tone of the movie.-Minus One has lines that really match the expectations of post-war Japan, moving alongside the main character's part in life and gradually matching it to feel approachable and believable.-There was natural comedy built in to liven things up, mixed well with more dramatic writing that matches the dramas on Netflix and other streaming platforms.-And to even give that science fiction feeling as well, but never getting lost into what feels like a theoretical physics book, aces in my books for making things moving well.The Pacing: -There are slow parts to this film, but they are fewer than I anticipated, only getting lost in the sullen times to help with building up the next act.-Instead, the movie surprisingly works in how it again builds up the characters around the big monster, pitting man vs. Beast in another battle for survival.-Despite being heavily centered on human, Minus One is a plus on just how well it keeps things moving, with most of the 125 minute run time flying by for me well.-Moving fast enough to balance characters and monster time to give enough of both, and yet not so fast that all this attempts at character development have been a waste.The Acting: -It's good in regards to the feel of the movie for me, somehow delivering strong lines despite me not understanding a lick of Japanese.-Kamiki's acting is solid, feeling one part real-life anime meets epic monster performance. He's got his emotions under control for the most part, though the crying is a little forced and fake sounding. Still, facial expressions and character acting are solid, good details to help show the burden on his mind and make me resonate with his struggles.-Ando is fine for the time she is on screen. Her opening acts are stellar for delivering those key line moments, but she doesn't get enough screen time to really maximize the full motion I think she could have brought.-Hamabe on the other hand has plenty of time, and she was probably the best of the bunch in terms of elegant balance, beautiful delivery with poetic phrasing, and just a touch of emotional explosion when needed. Such a great dynamic she established with just about every character.Godzilla: -The beast is a design to pay tribute to the original beast that got this all started. His movement, frame, and face are all sculpted to the classic rubber suit and a fan like me loved it.-The modern day graphics help add better texture, fluid movement, and some added features to help give him that deadlier edge we've grown accustomed to.-His movement has organic anatomy to it, but on land that classic gait of being sort of bloated and hindered worked amazingly for me and again a nice little nod to the fanbase.-And when action emerges, it's got that feeling of classic monster movie moments, but again having that edge of modern cinema to bring you into the movement. The way Godzilla reels to damage, the way he moves to maximize damage, and even the water moments are epic in that Jaws like manner.-throw in some other tricks that CGI makes easier to achieve, and the Godzilla really does have a few more tricks that this \"realistic\" approach did well.The Action: -Is it the best action moments I've seen? No, I won't lie that there is more that could have been done.-Yet, the movie accomplishes again that classic monster fight, where humanity fights this gargantuan monster and has to find the secret to beating it.-I loved the gradual approach to tackling Godzilla's wrath, the battlefields chosen, the planning, the adaptation, and again graphic work to help things come together.-Add the story investments, the stakes, and again this multiangle approach to bring everyone into the fray was stellar and it accomplished an action scene I was more invested in than many modern action movies.The Cinematography: -By far, the movie has the presentation to help add all that extra flair to the movie, helping it stand alone from what the American cinema does.-The filters on the camera alone just add so much, one part old time feel to the decade, but yet still has that sheen to keep the realism high.-Under strong direction, the crew uses great editing to help add great texture, emotion, with sad shadows of darkness during the heavier moments, and that gorgeous blue yellow and golden light during the moments of revering.-And then to pick a bunch of unique angles to give you the full effect of the chaotic moments. You'll get epic destruction from various points of views, wide shots of Godzilla seeming to choose his next target, and fast paced movement that keeps you more engaged than the static images do.-It all matches together in this artistic twist to the rather unartistic movie, and perhaps makes this movie stand out more than anything from most of the other predecessors.DISLIKES:Subtitles: -More a warning than a dislike, if you don't want to read your movie, then learn Japanese or avoid the film.-Those who don't want to keep up with faster reading, or might fall asleep, are going to struggle a bit with this movie, and you might find the acting a tad diluted because of it.More Time With Characters: -So many promising characters and only so much time to get them, Godzilla Minus One accomplishes much, but just doesn't use all the characters to the same light.-Several secondary characters that have promise and use are sort of dropped and forgotten, only randomly appearing at random times.-These side stories and character arcs hold so much potential, and then again hastily get wrapped up, and are the weaker aspects of the story.-And when it comes to one member of the family, I can't say that it was the best use, or need of a little kid compared to what they were trying to accomplish with her.-A shame given the potential, but it's bearable given the characters we do get are done so well.More Action: -No surprise here, the movie needed to hike the action up a tad more and give me one sequence or more to the final sequence to show that desperate fight.-More coordination with the military? Or maybe more time with the characters we are knowing to face the rampage could have gone a bit farther for me.-I wanted to have that epic build up and some failure, and really push it so the characters might not make it, which the final battle is building to it, but there is just more that could have been done for me.-Perhaps even having Godzilla's intelligence show a bit more like they were doing could have been added as well, to really give that intense war chess I like in movies.-Though fortunately, we still have more time and involvement with Godzilla than we did for a lot of the first movie.The VERDICT:Godzilla Minus One proves you can blend artistic style and popular movies together and freshen things up. The presentation is solid, great camera work being the lead to pull this movie together and accomplish much in this new start. Solid sound editing and great visual effects only further take this monster movie to larger heights, and brought the attitude that they needed. The Japanese cast brings a top notch performance, helping liven up fantastic dialogue and make this story feel deeper and more personable than others, putting the American stories to shame. And to bring all this together with just good character development and meshing action and story between human and beast... well it really impressed me more than I thought it would. Sure the pacing is a bit off at times, some characters get the shaft and there is more that can be done, but Minus One is a solid entry int eh Godzilla empire that I look forward to watching it again or seeing if it takes off. Most of those wanting monster mashing and monster vs. Monster, need to wait for the next entry in that universe, but for those wanting a good Jaws like movie, catch this one in theater for the best experience in my opinion.My Scores are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0."

I have yet to watch that movie and not fall asleep through it. So when I seen Godzilla Minus One, it blew me away. It is easily one of the best Godzilla movies out there. At least in the top 5. I'd honestly recommend this movie even if you're not a Godzilla fan. It is seriously that good. The humans were great in this movie. You really felt for them and can see how they got to their mindset. The effects were really good. It really looks like a guy is in a rubber suit, just like the good old days, but it is entirely CGI and with it being done on just a budget of 15 million dollars. There is no excuse for a 250 million dollar movie to look terrible when this movie made everything work with 15 times less of a budget.

If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release."

This is the closest Toho has come to matching the original film. Director Takashi Yamazaki just made a new class of Godzilla film. Themes of forgiveness, survivors' guilt, PTSD, family and learning that life is a gift are all touched on here. The story of Shikishima and Noriko is full of heart, and you genuinely care about the family unit they form, which ultimately guts your heart when the King of the Monsters arrives. I teared up more than once. Godzilla is a true villain here. He's a devastating force that's here to claim Japan as his own and this film shows his power like never before. Every foot fall is felt, his tail swipe crushes buildings, his atomic breath levels everything in its path. I've never been more terrified of Godzilla than I was here. The soundtrack by Naoki Sato is perfect and the use of the Ifukube theme was amazing. The special effects are great, and the cinematography is glorious.

The Human characters were very well written, the acting was outstanding, the emotions were strong with loss, pride and hope. The main cast were perfect together as a group, even the minor characters were amazing. The music, Oh My God the Music was conducted to fit every scene it was in and the OG theme was incredible to hear in a Dolby theater for the first time. Akira Ifukube would be proud, May he Rest In Peace. Lastly it was very educating in a way to see what Japan was like immediately after the War following the Atomic Bombs. The hardships they went through just to rebuild was very emotional to watch, but the way they climbed out of that pit of hopelessness would inspire any viewer to the franchise both Long Time along with Newer FansNow to the matter at Hand, the Star Himself, GODZILLA.The King of the Monsters is more terrifying in this movie than any other in the 69 year history of the Longest running franchise in the World! Every time he appears on screen he strikes fear into your very soul and leaves you in Awe at the same time. His destruction was unrelenting, the action out of this world, his Power Godly, his portrayal Very Real. At times you almost feel sorry for him because what's happened to him wasn't his fault. I haven't seen a monster movie this well done since Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) and Cloverfield (2008).My solid review of this movie is a 10/10, and I recommend save notifications of any kind for when this movie hits the Home Media market because I sure will.Honestly I don't think I've ever watched a movie this perfect beforeLast note, The Whole Theater shook everytime Godzilla took a Step and my very bones were vibrating from his Roar #godzilla #godzilla1954 #godzillaminusone #monster #japan."

It's no doubt thanks to all new creators' mindset to try to outperform the previous works, based on and standing at the established brand \"Godzilla\". All the successors can benchmark the prior ones and analyze their successful points and failures. Yamazaki learned a lot from Anno's work and made some improvements and corrections particularly on the point that it couldn't catch on overseas. One of them is the music. He succeeded in taking on Naoki Sato, who is the graduate of Tokyo university of the arts, paying respect to the alumni and predecessor Ifukube and understanding his music deeply. In this film, vision and music are fantastically synchronized. And of course, the main character is Godzilla, but Yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object. Therefore, we can empathize fully with characters competing with Godzilla. Yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence, and is expected to deliver another sequel of Godzilla film, in which we can see a \"real\" duel with monsters like Ghidra or Mothra."

There is a seen in this film where Godzilla is chasing a small boat that you will not soon forget it is terrifing.Other than the 1st Godziila film this is the best Godziila film but it is more than a Godziila film . It is a great overall film with emotion compassion and yet very scary.The visualized Godzilla is very well done with many close up shots were you can appreciate his anger and intelligence. A very well done story line and solid acting. I saw this film in an IMAX which was quite an experience. After the film they were handing out IMAX Godzilla posters . And basically every one took a poster . The movie lobby was filled with people staying to discussing the film they had just seen.

This film not only is a good movie BUT is also one the best \"monster\" movies I've seen. It's a return to form for the franchise with surprisingly great results. It also did something that I did not think it could do,It took the human characters and made you care about them.

Possibly only the first one from 1954 could top it as it was original, deep and far ahead of its time.Weird...there's this recent trend of making Reboot/Remake/Sequel/Prequels of classics - all rolled into one. Only some kinda work. This MORE than works. Its setting was perfect and I truly can't believe this never occurred to them before. This was kinda like the Rogue (Minus) One of Godzilla flicks.Immediately at the end of WWII and through the recovery process, Japan is hit once again, but this time by a VICIOUS, ANGRY God...zilla. They hadn't even begun to put the pieces of their lives back together and the big guy isn't going to let them off the hook for WWII. In fact, you actually feel very sorry for our old enemy (at the time) because of the giant green's wrath halting their healing.But, that's just the Godzilla portion of the movie. The REAL plot has incredible heart. I even teared up several times.The real story is of a \"coward\" who dodged Kamikazeing himself at the end of WWII and the repercussions of that. While he's trying to heal/cope, in comes both the title character and a new family to help care for. You follow him, his new friends and partner of sorts with a baby girl while he's dealing with both PTSD and the big baddie who's really into destruction.I know a ton of Godzilla/Kaiju films focus on the humans more than the monsters for various reasons: cheaper to shoot humans than large battles/annihilation scenes, probably can only show a giant monster stomping around for so long and we're supposed to root for the central characters, for examples. But, of ALL the Godzilla movies, including the Monsterverse (2014's Godzilla, 2019's Godzilla: King of the Monsters and 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong) that I really love a lot, not a single Godzilla movie made me care this much about the characters. I really felt something for the main characters A TON.Overall, I really loved the settings, cinematography, CGI, ALL of the characters here, the depth and scope of the stakes at hand, the POV of the Japanese after WWII and what their country did to their own citizens and how they improved the Godzilla look. He looked FANTASTIC. Plus, the new way they handled his atomic breath...absolutely amazing.I cannot recommend this movie enough. I truly hope this opens the door to much more mature, thought-out and well-made Godzilla films made by all-around great talents.***Final Thoughts: While it wasn't the very last one, I'm SUPER GLAD this was 1000x better than the last Japanese-made Godzilla film I saw: 2016's Shin Godzilla. I took a chance with Minus One after being INCREDIBLY let down by Shin Godzilla. That was a two-hour movie where Godzilla clocked in for about 5-minutes of screentime MOST of which was him evolving from a Laugh-Out-Loud, bugged-eyed CGI-abomination. The rest of the movie were board members in a boring room trying to decide what to do about the creature. Minus One was the POLAR opposite of Shin, thank God...zilla."

                "content": "Set in post World War II Japan, Kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns to the ruins of Tokyo racked with survivor's guilt over running from his duty as a kamikaze and being the survivor of an attack by a creature known only as Godzilla. With Koichi's parents both dead, he soon finds renewed purpose when he meets fellow survivor Noriko (Minami Hamabe) who is caring for orphaned infant Akkiko (Sae Nagatani). As the three build an unconventional family over the next two years with Koichi finding work as a minesweeper ridding the waters of leftover U. S. and Japanese sea mines, Godzilla returns to wreak havoc upon Japan carrying with it deadly nuclear power.Godzilla Minus One is the latest Japanese produced Godzilla film from Toho following their last effort from 2016 with Shin Godzilla. Due to the nature of the deal with Legendary Picture's own Monsterverse, Toho had to abstain from producing their own Godzilla productions (save for some anime projects) and the company's return to the Godzilla franchise was further put off by other factors such as Covid. Takashi Yamazaki incorporated the feelings of anxiety felt in recent years into his approach for the film and decided to set the film in the immediate aftermath of Japan's defeat in World War II to add to the feeling of bleakness in his approach for Godzilla as an embodiment of fear. Now graced with a wide U. S. release that hasn't been seen for a Japanese Godzilla film since Godzilla 2000, I'm pleased to say Godzilla Minus One might well be not just a contender for the best Godzilla film, but also one of the year's best films.What really stands out with Godzilla Minus One is the film's amazingly fleshed out characters and environment. With very rare exceptions many Godzilla movies often feel like the human characters are there more out of obligation than any other reason and with the exception of maybe Dr. Serizawa from the original 1954 film (and maybe Raymond Burr's Steven Martin from the U. S. re-edit) many would be hard pressed to tell you anything all that memorable about the human characters. With Godzilla Minus One Takashi Yamazaki's characters were so good and so fleshed out that I became invested to the point I often forgot this was a Godzilla movie. The characters of Koichi, Noriko, and Akiko make for an engaging family who we really grow to care about especially since they're three broken people who've inadvertently come together almost without realizing it to form themselves into a whole. Ryunosuke Kamiki gives a great performance as Koichi and his heartbreakingly raw performance of a man struggling with PTSD and survivor's guilt is beautifully realized and gives a solid arc that pays off in a satisfying way. The movie also features a great supporting cast including Koichi's shipmates who are all memorable and engaging in their own right often adding a level of humor and humanity that keeps the film from becoming overwrought.But just because the movie features a lot of character and emotion it doesn't forget it's also a kaiju movie and Yamazaki certainly delivers on that front giving us the most gritty, intense, and often times scary version of this material one can recall of recent memory. Yamazaki films Godzilla Minus One very much like a war movie with the action rarely leaving the level of the human characters which helps to drive home how imposing and powerful of a force Godzilla is in the movie. In many ways the filmmaking reminded me of recent benchmarks in the war genre such as 1917 and Dunkirk in how tense and thrilling the action scenes are. Godzilla himself just looks fantastic and is absolutely terrifying in some scenes with a great introductory scene dwarfed by a later scene where he chases a wooden minesweeper. The fact the movie's only made for $15-20 million (estimated) and looks better than some films that cost 10 times that much only makes it all the more impressive.Godzilla Minus One was a real pleasant surprise. Being a lifelong Godzilla fan I expected to like Godzilla Minus One, but I never expected to be as impressed as I was with the characters and story as I was with the technical aspects. I'm not joking when I say I feel this movie could be a contender for Best Foreign Language Film at next year's Academy Awards."

                "content": "\"Godzilla is the son of the atomic bomb... ...He is a nightmare created out of the darkness of the human soul. He is the sacred beast of the apocalypse. As long as the arrogance of Man exists, Godzilla will survive...\" - David Kalat, author, \"A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series\"\"Godzilla Minus One\" is living proof that in the words of one viewer over on YouTube, you can re-tell the exact same story a dozen different ways and you can still produce an excellent end-product. Japan saw fit to reboot its long-running \"Godzilla\" series with \"Shin Gojira\" back in 2016, and has re-booted the franchise, yet again, with \"Godzilla Minus One,\" which was released in Japanese theaters on November 3rd, 2023, to mark the 69th anniversary of the film that started it all, Ishiro Honda's grim black & white \"Gojira\" (1954); \"Godzilla Minus One\" saw an American theatrical release today on December 1st, 2023, making it the first Japanese-produced \"Godzilla\" film to be released theatrically in the United States since \"Shin Gojira,\" which itself was the first Japanese-produced \"Godzilla\" film to be released domestically since \"Godzilla 2000\" (1999) (which as a tearful aside, was the last film I ever saw at the Cineplex Odeon at my local shopping mall before it closed down later that summer in 2000).As most readers here know, I am a life-long Godzilla fan; \"Gojira\" is my all-time favorite giant monster movie (and 1989's \"Godzilla vs. Biollante\" is my favorite giant monster \"versus\" movie and is a unique gem amongst giant monster movies and \"Godzilla\" movies, more specifically - I love it). When I had first heard that Toho was planning on releasing yet another kaiju-eiga (\"Japanese monster movie\") featuring the mighty \"King of the Monsters,\" I began to get really excited. (It's really hard for me to get excited about most new movies these days for a litany of reasons. More on this in a bit.) Of course, Toho was keen to keep the very specific details of the movie under wraps, which only made the anticipation greater. (I had experienced that same sensation of immense excitement when \"Shin Gojira\" received a one-week distribution stateside back in 2016, and I had to drive all the way to Washington, D. C., from my home in Northern Virginia, which is where the nearest theater playing the film was located.)As written and directed by visual effects specialist Takashi Yamazaki, \"Godzilla Minus One\" takes a huge creative leap with firmly established Godzilla lore by going back to the beginning. Well, not just going back to the beginning, but going back even FURTHER than when things first began with \"Gojira\" in 1954. Yamazaki's film opens during the closing days of World War II in Japan, and ends two years later in 1947 - seven years before Honda's original. We all know the story of how a fictional dinosaur species called a \"Godzillasaurus,\" which was living on a deserted island in the South Pacific Ocean after the Second World War, was then exposed to radioactive fallout from American nuclear weapons testing in the region, and how it later mutated into a gargantuan, seemingly indestructible fire-breathing beast that later attacked Japan - Gojira (\"Godzilla,\" in English).But right there, by setting \"Godzilla Minus One\" immediately after Japan's defeat in World War II and having Godzilla appear much sooner than he did in Ishiro Honda's original, Yamazaki's film stands apart from \"Gojira\" and it gives Yamazaki some new creative and dramatic territory to explore - in this case, how Japan, already at its lowest point after having surrendered to the Allies following the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945, must now contend with another looming disaster of unprecedented scale: an attack by a gigantic, radioactive, fire-breathing monster (or daikaiju, \"giant strange beast\").The story here focuses on Imperial Japanese Navy kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who in the final days of WWII in 1945, lands on Odo Island after feigning that his plane is experiencing technical issues. He meets with the lead mechanic there, Sokaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), and during the night their camp is attacked by a giant dinosaur that comes ashore from the ocean and slaughters everyone except Shikishima and Tachibana, who comes to blame Shikishima for his hesitation at a critical moment which resulted in the deaths of all their comrades.Later that year after Japan's surrender, Shikishima, wracked with survivor's guilt, returns to Tokyo, which has been ravaged by Allied fire-bombing raids - raids that claimed the lives of both his parents. (As an aside, these scenes of a devastated post-war Tokyo have to be a visual reference to the eye-witness accounts given by Ishiro Honda himself after he'd been discharged from service overseas in the Imperial Japanese Army, and then toured Hiroshima on his way home following the city's atomic bombing, and he later used these experiences to form his vision of the character of Godzilla. And as a matter of fact, Yamazaki, as a visual effects artist, has a nice taste for shocking and unsettling imagery - the first sighting of the un-mutated Godzillasaurus, the actual first appearance of Godzilla at sea or the so-called \"black rain\" following the giant monster's later rampage on Tokyo, are some prime examples - which makes his film one of the more visually interesting \"Godzilla\" features ever produced.) While salvaging what little he has left, he meets Noriko (Minami Hamabe), another war orphan who carries in her tow, an infant girl named Akiko (Sae Nagatani), whose mother perished in the fire-bombing raids and had charged Noriko with the child's care. He allows the two of them to move in with him and a loose family of sorts is born.Pretty soon, however, Japan, which is only in the early stages of reconstruction (just at it was in \"Gojira\"), is threatened by the terror of Godzilla, who rises from the Pacific Ocean to unleash his wrath on a country that has already suffered heavy devastation brought on by nuclear bombers, and must now face a threat that could destroy the country completely. Since Japan cannot rely on its military (the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces were disbanded in 1945 following the surrender, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces - JSDF - weren't founded until July of 1954) or the United States (Japan would not begin to enter into a series of mutual security and cooperation legislative agreements with the U. S., and thus become our closest Asian ally, until the early 1950s) for aid - due to rising tensions with the Soviet Union - it is up to Shikishima and a few other dedicated private citizens to defeat Godzilla and protect what little country of theirs that is left to protect.\"Godzilla Minus One\" is a thrilling cinematic event the likes of which I have not experienced since, well, \"Shin Gojira.\" I should now state here that I rarely go to the movies anymore, as there just isn't much out there these days that truly interests me. Since superhero movies no longer carry the geeky thrill that they once did for this viewer, I found \"Godzilla Minus One\" to be a much-welcomed shot in the arm, and something very, very different from much of what I've seen lately. That it was a subtitled foreign-language feature that had received a wide distribution stateside (\"Godzilla 2000\" had a wide theatrical release back in 2000, while, as stated earlier, \"Shin Gojira\" only had a one-week engagement back in 2016), \"Godzilla Minus One\" lives up to its high expectations and by going in a different direction from the anti-bureaucratic satire of \"Shin Gojira\" and by extension the dark apocalyptic tone of \"Gojira,\" this makes it stand out from much of the fare that I've seen in recent years, and even other \"Godzilla\" films.What also makes \"Godzilla Minus One\" stand out is that it's a feature that is not steeped in nostalgia or purposeful throwbacks to the \"Godzilla\" films of yesteryear (most domestic so-called \"legacy\" features love doing that for eagle-eyed, dog-eared fans of the originals to compensate for a lack of originality). Yes, \"Godzilla Minus One\" does include some obligatory references to films past, including some familiar musical themes by the late Akira Ifukube, who also created Godzilla's signature roar in the original 1954 \"Gojira\" and who remained Japan's most esteemed composer until his death in 2006. But this film is not about an avid fan-boy geeking out and showing off his hero-worship of the material. No, \"Godzilla Minus One\" is simply a tale of a country trying to pick itself up again following the end of a devastating conflict - a conflict that nearly destroyed the nation - and having to face a force of nature more dangerous and destructive than any war. That is perhaps where Takashi Yamazaki succeeds the most, and his film is also not steeped in the usual anti-American resentment and finger-pointing and anti-nuclear allegory, and - and! - the assertive pro-Japanese nationalist sentiment of most recent \"Godzilla\" movies (a more recent phenomenon that has been pervasive in many \"Godzilla\" features since the early 1990s, after Japan had fully rebuilt its economy and was looking to re-assert itself on the global market).\"Godzilla Minus One\" is a \"Godzilla\" film that was well worth the seven-year wait.\"Godzilla Minus One\" rates a solid \"10.\"10/10."

For Japan, the war was not over.The unforgettable production utilizes some of the original Godzilla music. It is in Japanese with English subtitles.The story is pro-human. Seeing how people cared for each other in the midst of disaster is what moved me to tears. No snarky or edgy dialog or lame jokes that ruin so many Hollywood scripts in my opinion. Come to think of it, I can't remember a single humorous moment in the movie, though there were moments of joy and comraderie.It is a story about grass roots self-reliance and cooperation. Although some military men assist them, the Japanese realize that their government won't save them. Scientists and former military men come together, borrow some military equipment form a plan to defeat Godzilla.It is also a story about cowardice, the crippling shame that comes with it, and how cowardice can actually buy time for one to build one's courage.

                "content": "\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film \"Killers of the Flower Moon\", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10."

It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered \"medicine\" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !"

This time, I was scared to look at the watch because I never leave the cinema without finishing a. Movie. I know it's Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest directors who made phenomenal movies like Taxi Driver, Wolf of Wall Street and The Departed, but honestly, Scorsese shmorsese for making this one 2 hours longer than it had to be.The story is about a tribe of Native Americans who discovered oil in Osage at the start of 20th century. Our protagonist Earnest (DiCaprio) and his uncle (De Niro) are on a mission to snatch that money for themselves. It's a nice story that could have been an 8/10 as it explores the topics of greed, colonisation and cultural erasure without any consequences. It also came out at a perfect time considering the current events, but did it have to be sooooo damn loooong?Knowing the title of the film, you automatically know it's ending so that alone saps out all the mystery. For what is supposed to be a sad story, the film doesn't create any emotional weight to make us care for it's characters and as a result, it's hard to connect with anything. De Niro and Fraser did a fine job but DiCaprio looked like a pitiful aging boar instead of the young, sly and seductive fox he was meant to be.The costumes and decorations were great but it's like they forgot about the audience while making this film. The story repeats the same trope again and again creating zero tension for us to be invested in until the final 30 minutes. Moreover, it's as if the whole cast, was injected with ketamine as they looked and sounded lethargic adding more weight to the dragging pace.If Scorsese wanted to make an impact then he should've used emotions and tension instead of 600 pauses, glances and empty conversations. He was trying to say a lot in the epilogue about tragedy being hidden behind entertainment and profit but by the time the epilogue finally came, I was happy to go home instead of being floored by the sadness. It's an important story that sadly didn't work out as an impactful drama.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews."

Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: \"Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it.\" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment."

After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible."

                "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. \"King\" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the \"old\" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to \"them with the gold make the rules.\" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023."

It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film."

For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale."

First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

                "content": "I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history."

                "content": "First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious \"Ernest\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle \"King\" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, \"Mollie\" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, \"Ernest\" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more \"suitable\" owners. This sudden spate of \"accidents\" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious \"White\" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the \"King\" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - \"Mollie\" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the \"white\" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better \"Irishman\" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again."

It finds the legendary filmmaker at the top of his game (he's been there since 2013 it seems, with an amazing unbroken streak), telling what might be his bleakest and most emotionally distressing story yet.It was expected that a film about a series of real-life killings committed by greedy people against indigenous people was never going to be easygoing, but it's the execution here that counts. It's constant dread and an exploration of twisted, manipulative, and often downplayed evil (at least in the eyes of the evildoers) that's always in the shadows, and just hidden enough to ensure such violence continues. It disturbs and creeps up on you in ways that are difficult to anticipate or prepare oneself for.It's an exploration of the death by a thousand cuts equivalent of atrocious, systemic murder. Seeing blatant crime against a race or group of people is troubling when it's out in the open, but in depicting it as both blatant and sometimes in a more insidious and calculated way, it makes you think about how many similar cases might've happened that weren't noticed or brought to light - not just in America, but anywhere with indigenous populations. It's here where Killers of the Flower Moon isn't just powerful for the specific story being told (and it is), but for what it suggests on a broader level.It's like Shoah, in that way - the lengthy and soul-crushing Holocaust documentary from 1985 that is as much about the horrifying banality and numbing effect of great, widespread, non-stop evil as it is about laying bare what evils were committed. The pacing and length of Killers of the Flower Moon are essential to conveying these things. Having to spend so much time with this story and these troubling themes makes them all the more impactful.The film's beautifully shot, masterfully edited, and the three leads - Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, and Robert De Niro - are all deserving of awards recognition. Those who thought The Irishman dragged might feel the same here, but I thought it earned just about every minute of its 3.5 hour runtime.Complaints? DiCaprio contorts his face like a bulldog the whole movie - I only noticed at about the 2.5 hour mark, but I couldn't shake the mental image. It's still a great performance, and the character he portays here is unlike any other he's ever played. There is also a sense of creeping familiarity to parts of the final act, but some interesting turns are taken. And then the ending... the final scene and then the very last shot are both brilliant, and helped the film end on a powerful note. That being said, I do expect the final scene to be divisive.

My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in \"Dredd.\" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it.

It was with this in mind that I was extremely excited to watch this film.Instead Scorsese's inability to make proper cuts to his films (see The Irishman) makes an otherwise well told story a drag. Good moviemakers know how to compress good books to fit a two to two and a half hour window. He seems to have lost this ability and the result is too many redundant scenes that are repeating the same dialogue.This is especially the case with the constant manipulation between De Niro and DiCaprio, both of whom put in captivating performances even if they are inappropriately cast as characters that are supposed to be decades younger. Multiple scenes between the two could have been removed with only positive results.The ultimate conclusion to this film is predictably clear after about an hour, yet it takes well over two more hours to get there leaving much of the audience exhausted and disinterested by the end. This is such a disappointment and a disservice to this subject that I actually felt anger towards the director instead of the people who perpetrated such atrocities against the Osage people."

There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise."

                "content": "\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. \"Masterpiece\" and \"a sprawling crime epic\" are just a few of the praises \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.\"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, \"Flower Moon\" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found \"Flower Moon\" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two."

I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years."

It is simply far too long and the large parts of the film proceed at a snails pace.Rather like the portrayal of the Tulsa race riots at the start of the Watchmen TV series, it does shed light on an ugly slice of 20th century American history, but for a film that purports to champion the cause of the Osage people (and perhaps remind Us citizens of the plight of first nation Americans in general) it provides them with no agency at all. Despite their new found riches they are presented as largely passive, often easily duped and in need of saving by the good ol' FBI (though only after receipt of a fat old fee)."

One of his justifications is that people \"sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours\" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film.

They would've been great to watch act out the true story & honor the tragedy. Instead it's really kind of honoring the Burkhart men by giving their story so much focus & screentime & it's almost as if giving them a voice when they don't deserve it from all the awful things those men did. They shouldn't have had a voice the Osage should have it or Mollie. I realize that without the star appeal people sadly wouldn't have come out to see it but they could've been in it just the same.

Even when Mahito, his dad, and a new woman move to the countryside, he still hears his mom's voice calling to him from the fire. In dreams and with the encouragement of a mysterious heron, Mahito enters an abandoned and magical tower where he hopes to get clues to his mom's whereabouts. It may be an elaborate trap.This complex, beautiful, deeply imaginative, and many-layered film continues Miyazaki's amazing and awe-inspiring legacy. He is one of my favorite directors. In nature, wisdom about living, magic, charismatic guides (female as well as male), folklore, cute puffball critters, war/chaos, wackiness including flesh-eating parakeets, portals to other worlds, loss, and love, Miyazaki continues to run with favorite and endearing themes. The film is full of insight into what it means to be human. I was so happy to be part of the first audience to see the film outside of Japan.There is depth in the story, characters, music, voices (much better in Japanese), and especially the artwork. I'm mesmerized just by the drawings and movement of the clouds. Oh and there are fantastic and intricately drawn ocean waves, moonlight reflected on water, vivid colors, resplendent contrasts of light and dark, elaborate tree branches, night skies with resplendent stars and meteors, grasses realistically swaying in the wind, alluring shadows, and so much more. The Boy and the Heron is worth watching for the artwork alone."

                "content": "I've probably started a review of a Hayao Miyazaki film stating it's his final film before, but \"The Boy and the Heron\", for more reasons than one, certainly feels like the final cut. Now aged eighty-two with an ever-increasing gap between films, it would sadly appear unlikely another feature will be made. \"The Boy and the Heron\" would show that Miyazaki now also knows the gig is up, feeling like a culmination of a life's work, looking backwards rather than forwards.Mahito's (Soma Santoki) mother is killed in a Tokyo fire, and so later goes to live in the countryside with his father and stepmother (also his aunt). His father the owner of an aeronautics factory, he has a large plot to explore, finding a mysterious old building. But he also finds himself stalked by a grey heron (Masaki Suda) who appears to mean him harm.But with his stepmother Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura) going missing, he confronts the heron and the pair go looking for her, finding themselves at the mysterious building of unknown origin. This takes them into worlds within worlds, as they are helped and hindered along the way by various people and creatures.There's a lot going on here, and, it's fair to say, too much. There are some good moments, but this is a film that gets a little lost within itself as it tries to squeeze in too much into its two hours. While there are similarities in all of his films, each has its own unique charm. \"The Boy and the Heron\", however, feels more like a greatest hits parade, with many moments reminiscent of what has come before. You can probably go through the whole film and equate moments to earlier works every step of the way.Whether intentional or not, this can show both a filmmaker struggling for original ideas, but also a messy and convoluted storyline that can become difficult to follow and disengaging. Miyazaki films can almost be made by their moments for reflection, but here you barely feel able to breath as we race into another world of new characters. The result is a film that has some of the confusion and struggles of some of Ghibli's - not just Miyazaki's - lesser works, such as \"The Cat Returns\" (2002) and \"Tales from Earthsea\" (2006).A problem for Miyazaki is that you are judging his films by such high standards, in a career that has never really declined, just become sparse. This is good, but it is by no means great; probably most reminiscent of \"How's Moving Castle\" (2005) in that it tries to open too many doors. Miyazaki is at his best when he keeps things simple, but feels like he's trying to push the magic and wonder here, rather than let it out naturally.Comedy is perhaps the strength of the film, with more outright laughs than I can remember from Miyazaki before. To start, the elderly maids of the country house, while familiar in design, have the mannerisms of excited children, hungry for treats from the big city. Though Suda as the heron is the standout, starting as a squawking threat, but becoming the buddy sidekick and a constant source of humour, as one of Miyazaki's most comical characters.As ever, Joe Hisaishi delivers a memorable soundtrack, with a sparse and simple piano a reminder that Ghibli is at its best when uncomplicated. And simplicity is the word for the somewhat abrupt ending. In a film that has so much going on, the coda is almost notable in its inactivity, and feels like a fitting way to end. A career that has brought so much, should say a quick goodbye and leave us with good memories.Politic1983.home.blog."

It was announced almost as a surprise with the words \"Hayao Miyazaki's last movie\". With this amount of hype, including the amazing reviews it's got from critics, my hype was built up to the max. The end result? Not what I expected, and that's ok!Let's get to the positives, the animation is STUNNING. The way Hayao Miyazaki manages to build these worlds and characters is just an amazing feat, they all come alive with the colours and the movement. Another positive is the tone of the movie, I really hate Disney for trying to market this as a kid's movie, when it's not. It's got some unnerving and scary moments and themes that are not suited for kids, which is good. Hayao Miyazaki is at his best when he manages to blend the adult with the fantastical.The actors are always amazing, I saw the Japanese dub so I don't know how the western VAs are doing but wow; they all do a fantastic job!Now to the negatives... a huge thing about Studio Ghibli movies in general, especially the ones from Hayao Miyazaki, is that they're always by rule driven by the characters, it's their journey that's in the front. World building and narrative always takes a second place in his movies to be able to not distract from the characters journeys, big examples of this are Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle where the world building is built by very simple and effective means and rules. But here in the Boy and The Heron the world building is so convoluted and confusing it almost feels like he wanted it to take center stage in this movie and it's such a shame because it feels at like it's at odds with it's own main character who supposedly undergoes a deep deep emotional journey but it all finishes off in a very abrupt and unfitting send-off in the end which really confused me and just didn't feel like a good payoff.Also the way this movie introduces characters left and right with no rhyme or reason is super confusing. Once again, Hayao Miyazaki did this very minimally in his past movies where the characters get room to be explored and to leave an impact in the story but here once again it's at odds with its own world building- it all feels very haphazard and messy. The Heron is a fun character but I don't feel like he or Mahito do or learn anything from these adventures.Now, it may sound like I hated this movie, but I didn't. It's just that I care so much about Hayao Miyazaki movies and Studio Ghibli movies that I can't help to compare them to the movies we've seen before. And despite it not being Hayao Miyazaki's best it's still pretty good, it's very much worth a watch."

Like those films it inhibits a certain darkness and maturity at times with a war as a backdrop, that is not really aimed at children. I personally liked it and wished that more filmmakers in animation would have similar aspirations, but I guess those who do are expelled to do short movies. But back to Miyazaki's movie: it is bursting with lots of ideas, symbolism and fairy tale motifs like Snow White (with a dead mother, seven dwarfettes and a glass coffin with a sleeping beauty). At other times the character dynamics invoke Jim Henson's Labyrinth, where the protagonist has to rescue a kidnapped loved one and work with a henchman who sells him out at every opportunity until they start bonding.All the visual ideas are great but sometimes they can unnecessary bloat the picture. It is one of Miyazaki weaknesses to be over-indulgent and unfocused at times, sometimes he needs to tighten the story in certain places - especially during the last stretch it can feel exhausting. I still like the leisurely pace in the beginning and that the movie takes it's time to slowly pull us into another world/afterlife/beforelife however you want to call this place. There are beautiful visual metaphors like when the little balloon creatures fly off into the next world, one can say that those symbolize the protagonists own emotions bubbling up into the surface (this is also the first sequence where we see the main character smile and express genuine emitions) - and that he tries to repress those feelings. Especially towards his new stepmom which he tries to rescue seemingly out of pure obligation for his father. It is also no coincidence that we witness the appearance of an avatar of his real mother in that very same sequence - she tries to protect those cute balloons from hungry predators, but in the process burns most of them. The clinging to the ghost from the past is preventing a new blossoming/beginning. There simply aren't easy and clean-cut solutions, neither in nature nor our society.There are certain moments where someone can get the impression that Miyazaki is making a statement towards his own legacy and the studio he helped to build. There are themes of responsibility & duty versus family sharing a lot of similarities to his last movie 'The Wind Rises' . I appreciated the ending, without getting into any spoiler territory, a lot of people wondered or were baffled why the final scene feels sort of \"tacked on\". But when you closely observe it, it is sound with the movie's themes and illustrates rather well the important choice of our main character."

When they arrive, they live in a nice and quiet home. In a place, were strange things did happen, and will happen, too. First of all, I have to list up what was good about the film. It was absolutely beautiful animation with great paint, drawing techniques, and amazing colors. They had that mix with painting-like animation, but at the same time, classic Japanese anime. And I really liked that, I think it is a very nice thing, and I can see that this is a technique that Studio Ghibli is using a lot, and they are really doing it well. Very nice music. It was soft, easy and quiet, but at the same time it built up a hidden suspense that was holding. The music was some sort of anxiety mixed with calmness. Very strange. Last thing that was good was the overall atmosphere and the feeling of the movie, at least in the first act. Because then things started to get a little weird. Everything became unknown and messy, the story changed the course multiple times, and I wasn't sure which way the plot was going to go. At the end everything became a little more clear, but still a little weird. When you don't know what is really going on, the action becomes a little nonsense, too. And that was exactly what happened. The action sequences were sometimes fun and entertaining, but I was still questioning: Why are they doing it? Why are they running? What are they running from? What's the point of the story? Good enough that they had a good moral at the end. Very great with a good message about the balance of the world, and that the soul value is very important. After all, this was a movie on the middle. Great music and animation. Fine atmosphere in the first act. But it got a little messy, and the story changed course to many times. They rushed a lot and I didn't get time to think.

Like Mahito, Himi too decides to leave the comforts of her fantasy world for the raw reality of life - war, pain, loss. It's her conscious choice, knowing it will eventually lead to her demise, that drives home the film's poignant message: it is not how we depart, but how we live that truly matters."

Plot points get tangled and forgotten about, some things feel like an afterthought, and it all just kinda feels a bit too familiar.I will say that I am happy to see such beautifully realized animation back on the big screen. Nobody does japanese animation quite as good as Ghibli does it. I was in awe seeing it on the IMAX, which was the best way to view it. You could see the dedication and detail that went into the artwork and appreciate it even more.After The Wind Rises, I was convinced Miyazaki would never make another film. I almost wished he hadn't. This film feels like a filmmaker who has already said everything he has to say. Tired and worn out. If it wasn't for the exquisite artwork throughout, I would've rated it lower.2.5 herons out of 5."

So, when I say I didn't particularly like \"The Boy and the Heron\"...well, that says a lot.The story is confusing and the ending seems, well, to kind of contradictory. I'll TRY to give a brief overview. The story is set in Japan during the later portion of WWII, though the war seems to play very little part in the story. It begins with a fire in which Mahito's mother is killed. A few years pass and Mahito and his father have moved out to the country because the father's fiancee lives there...plus, it is the war and being in a city was NOT a good thing. Mahito is shocked when a heron begins talking to him...and a weird human-like face emerges from the bill. Eventually, he and the heron enter a weird parallel world caused, apparently, by a strange meteorite and his great-great uncle. What happens next is confusing, so I'll just stop here.So many confusing story elements. Why did Mahito smash a rock against his skull early in the story? Why did the great-great uncle say he wanted Mahito's help...but then Mahito wakes up in chains! And, later, the great-great uncle says how much he likes Mahito...but what about the chains? There were more strange and inexplicable occurrances.While some might say that Miyazaki had made other confusing and difficult films, if you know about Japanese folklore and religion, films like \"Spirited Away\" make MUCH more sense. But this one is just confusing...and probably will be to Japanese audiences as well.I'm giving the film a 6 simply because the animation was nice and the film was original. But apart from that, the confusing story isn't fun, the characters aren't lovable and I think it's possibly his weakest movie."

Miyazaki builds an interesting fantasy world yet again, probably for the last time.But story telling and character development are a bit off. The narrative feels forced and not flowing naturally. In the older titles like Nausicaa, Spirited Away, or Howl's Moving Castle, strange things happen but the mystical worlds have their own rules and Miyazaki was masterful in subtly convincing us the way things worked in those worlds. But this movie has just too many things hastily cramped together and they don't have enough room to really sink in. Simply put, it's difficult to follow. The same thing goes for character development. The main protagonist (Mahito) grows up through an adventure, which is great, but his momemts of growth come abrupt and not really earned.It's a cliche by now that Miyazaki does magic, but this particular film doesn't have much of it. Strangely enough, it reminded me of Tales from Earthsea (2006) by Goro Miyazaki. This movie has many bits and pieces superficially resembling what we have seen in the previous Miyazaki films, but the sum is not greater than the parts."

It's as if we've entered a different universe for a short time and are watching random events that happen to occur. Nothing is specifically explained to us.Yes, it has always been enjoyable to watch the worlds created by Miyazaki's extraordinary imagination, but it bothers me that he finishes his films without filling in the gaps in the story. He did this partially in Howl's Moving Castle as well. By the way, this universe he created didn't draw me in as much as his other films did.Miyazaki's latest film can't even make it among the best. It lacks the awe-inspiring qualities of films like Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke. Still, it's a Miyazaki classic with its detailed animations and wonderful music.

I felt that Hayao Miyazaki used his own influences as a motif in order to create a work that would connect and influence the next generation.The King and the Mockingbird (Hepburn: Oh to Tori, lit. 'The King and the Bird') was released in Japan in 1957 under the title The shepherdess and the chimney sweep (Hepburn: Yabunirami no bo¯kun).

There is a lot to take in here, and it feels like Hayao Miyazaki going for broke and making a film that is the most Miyazaki-esque of any Miyazaki film. But while there are story beats, characters, and visuals that feel familiar, they're all mixed in a way that adds up to one unique-feeling film.It starts a little slow, and it takes a while to work out where it's going, but it's never boring and I was always impressed with how this film looked and sounded. The story and characters? Those elements are harder to get a grip on. Things are leisurely-paced near the start, and then accelerate to a ridiculous extent in the final act. I've heard Miyazaki writes by the seat of his pants, to some extent, and for better or worse, you really get the sense that's what he was doing throughout this film's second half. It makes for some of the most arresting and impressive parts of the film, but also the most confounding.Still, I don't think this feeling of being overwhelmed makes the film bad or sub-standard, and even when I was feeling confused or lost in the more fantastical elements on offer here, I was always interested and found myself enjoying the experience. There are complex ideas that, at least to me, weren't really fleshed-out or explained until the very end (those who like their fantastical worlds to have clearly established rules might be frustrated), but the bewilderment didn't take away too much from the stuff I liked. And The Boy and the Heron looks and sounds so good that I don't at all mind the idea of devoting another two hours to it sometime soon."

The film plays like a unconnected montage of Miyazaki's greatest hits, as you are transported from setting to setting through Mahito's eyes. The problem is that this results in an extremely fragmented story structure. Characters are weak as you are not given time to connect with them given the fast pace of the film. Characters establish no relationships with one another. One moment they are there, next they are gone as you are transported to a different setting. The settings also reference Miyazaki/Ghibli's past collaborations, which is completely meaningless to you and flies over your head unless you've watched them. The story's message is unclear, and not communicated properly to the viewer during the 2hr time frame, and basically requires knowledge outside the film to appreciate it in full. Unless you are willing to watch Miyazaki's previous 11 films and read a biography of his personal struggles the film just won't land."

Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak \"dramatic\" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."

                "content": "Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making \"a movie about World War 2\". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."

Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."

And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."

He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries.

It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the \"Will you shoot your emperor?\" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."

A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? \"You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing\"?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."

Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."

When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an \"epic\" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."

                "content": "Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused \"coward\" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any \"funny\" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."

I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't \"get\" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a \"highlights\" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except \"oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.\"The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."

No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon.

I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."

I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film.

It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills.

Never happened. We also see Napoleon to butcher unarmed civilians in Paris. Never happened. We see the russian tsar as a cool kid who defeated Napoleon. Yeah Napoleon lost many man due to famine and diseases. But the movie \"forget\" to highlight that the tsar sacrificed his own citizens just to hunger Napoleon. He burned his own cities and grain fields to make Napoleon unable to feed his men. All in all the tsar destroyed his own population to stop Napoleon. But the movie portrays him as a charming kid and Napoleon as some kind of monster...Not to mention the law and justice system Napoleon established. Code Civil brought equality to all the people in France. Half of the world adopted it. Basically it is the root of nowadays justice system. He demolished noble privileges and gave people equal rights. Not surprising the movie not even mentions these facts. It was way more important to show one more bizarre unpleasing sex scene.This movie is a disgusting attempt to discredit Napoleon.

The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky.

And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a \"near run thing\") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression \"phoning it in.\""

Scott decides to focus on three specific aspects of Napoleon's life and personality to show who he thinks Napoleon was at the expense of omitting much of what makes him such a fascinating figure in history.The first aspect Scott focuses on is Napoleon the lover. Much of this film shows his infatuation and on-again off-again relationship with Josephine. Both actors handle their parts well and while there is some humor and tension, it is the least interesting part of the movie. Still, some focus is necessary as his marriage to Josephine was certainly a key aspect of his life.The second aspect is Napoleon the megalomaniac. We all know of Napoleon as the short guy who had insecurity issues. Even if there is truth to this, it is probably an overstatement, but there is no denying the massive ego of the man. In many respects his ego is understandable for all he accomplished, and Scott paints Napoleon's inflated belief in himself as the reason for his fall, particularly in his invasion of Russia. Scott does not want us the think Napoleon fights for the glory of France but rather for the glory of Napoleon.The final side of the Napoleon casts him as a butcher. Towards the end of his career we see Napoleon recklessly spending the lives of his men as he seeks to conquer for himself. The movie leaves us with a comprehensive death toll that Napoleon left in his wake, a massive number that comes as a result of his callous disregard for his own men and endless ambition.So then we are left with a Napoleon as a man who loved Josephine, who had a massive ego, and constantly warred, causing the deaths of millions. All this is true, but what of Napoleon the tactician? What of Napoleon the reformer? What of Napoleon the leader? Scott focused on the worst aspects of Napoleon to highlight while disregarding the best. I was shocked that more was not discussed and shown over the massive victories and the unprecedented tactics he employed that make him a general still studied in military academies today. He was a multifaceted man, who accomplished much good and much bad, but he comes off in this film as a little ambitious fool.The film also seems jumbled at times and jumps forward in ways that show Napoleon must be conquering and doing something right, but he goes from general, to consul, to emporer in quick ways we are not shown. He beats Austria and Russa, befriends Russia, then is back at war with them one scene later. I understand the politics, battles, and alliances are hard to follow of the ealry 19th century, but I left feeling like I learned little more about Napoleon and the France he ruled than I already knew coming in.Despite the films shortcomings, it is a genuinely effective movie and shot beautifully. The battle scenes are bloody and tense, and the costumes and sets look recreate Napoleonic France beautifully."

Which is a story of a mentally unstable woman who tosses herself off a bridge to being fished out by a mad scientist who revives her using her unborn child's brain. Assuming that brain was female.Then the fun begins. She has a baby's brain which needs to evolve to the 30 year old she is at in the end. Though the dialogue has the humorous tone of that a foreigner speaking English, the laughs land here and there. Some seem to be forced. Emma Stone plays Bella, the main character who ages mentally throughout. Insatiable in attempting to gain knowledge but also carnal desire from men. I don't see Stone as that smoldering sex doll this movie wants her to be. But let's go along with it. The sex is raunchy, raw, sweaty and ugly. And the movie makes a case that a woman who sells her body for this is doing it as a survival skill. Enter any Only Fans joke or porn actresses name and see how they consider this woman empowerment. Instead, you'll find regret and emotional pain. Broken toys. But the flick doesn't end like this. Bella holds all the cards because she is a mentally stunted woman. Again, add the joke you want here. Are we to say, a dimbulb woman will gain the attention of men? Of course. She's helpless...until she's not. She has no filter. And the audience is suppose to enjoy her socially awkward banter. Well, except that of a Black cynic who forces her to think how damaged the world can be to her. Never mind that we never got the idea she was THAT naive.The great moments are delivered by Willem Dafoe as the mad scientist who has his own physical afflictions. He does surgery theater in the most sloppy of ways, yet due to his ability to push the boundaries discovers what he can do with brains. No questions asked here of logistics. He is always breath of fresh air when the heavy hand of messages perk up.The Mark Ruffalo character seems to symbolize the base nature of men. When they first meet a innocent girl, he will take advantage. And though they don't make him look sexually inept, they make him emotionally neutered. He begins to pine for Bella like a sad beta male. Which is the imagination of most women who consider themselves high value. This would included obese, ugly or broken. Any dating site illustrates this. In this story, men are three categories: The unconditional loving father, the man they use for sex, or the sweet guy who most likely gets friend-zoned but she comes back after all her options are exhausted. Naive for Bella? Yep.Is that really feminist?The story of \"Frankenhooker\" isn't much different. Though this is told from the beta male scientist who is a hopeless romantic. There is honesty to this film that doesn't exist in \"Poor Things\" In Yorgos' mind, men are buffoons who need just need to bang a good looking woman. And he isn't completely wrong. Too many now hold women in this regard. Due to being raised by single Mothers. Women take advantage of this. Bella isn't a victim here. She is a broken product of a single Dad who can't control his monster of a child.They attempt to save much of it by drawing this conclusion. Which is...are you done using men? Meanwhile pretending like her behavior in a French brothel isn't considered abysmal.Still, the staging and cinematography is tops. And if this gets male society to draw pitchforks to the theaters, so be it. Art is suppose antagonize, not answer questions."

And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but \"visually striking\" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"

She develop conscience and slowly carved herself into womanhood with some few man getting on her way.The First two thirds of the film works really well.Emma, Rufallo, Ramy Youssef were marvelous in their respective role.You could feel that Yorgos really camped it up and could see how he was enjoying the material. The visual game too in these portion is through the roof. All the jokes were hitting well. AND while do feel weird thinking that this is a baby trying to heck out of her loins, the most important thing about this is that there is a constant growth in Stone's character. She develops a childlike confidence in her ideas AND develop empathy. AND even gives some pointed observation of the questionable people around him.But something went south after the Paris scene.Everything that it is heading towards suddenly felt very empty.I just do not know if Emma's character is representing everything at all. Suddenly, all her growth just felt surface level. She wants everything and just gets everything. It became that 'Genius' plot AND it seems to lose track of what she really represent. It just became pure fantasia without any kind or semblance of a stakes. She just wants, and she gets. That really bothered me, since then film is positioned that she killed herself because she feels stifled by the her husband and his controlling ways.Its a liberation alright BUT it does not know what is she being liberated from. She just is free BUT with everything free to begin with.Overall, a great setup that fails to stick its landing. Overhyped."

                "content": "Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."

                "content": "While he is unmistakably a unique voice in cinema, I'm not as big of a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos as many critics and cinephiles tend to be. I sometimes feel that his films focus more on attempting to provoke and shock the viewer rather than, and at the expense of, putting compelling storytelling first. While his quirky and risqué new film \"Poor Things\" doesn't completely overcome that concern, it is a step in the right direction from a storytelling perspective. An occasionally rudderless plot and some not very well developed supporting characters prevents it from being a home run, but it's still a solid film that should please independent film lovers who know what they're getting themselves into.The film centers on Bella Baxter, a woman who is brought back to life with the brain of her baby by Goodwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe, who Bella refers to as \"God.\") The movie primarily centers around Bella's development and autonomy as she begins to understand the world around her, including her relationships with two very different men and her gradual questioning of her purpose and desire for liberation within the confines of a patriarchal society, particularly as it relates to sex. Despite some darker undertones, this premise has plenty of fodder for humor, which Lanthimos delivers. There is deadpan and screwball-style humor in various places throughout the film that feels clever and incisive, although some jokes feel a bit too forced or repetitive. The jokes and writing are complemented by the performances, which are generally very good but not always optimally effective in displaying a strong range. Emma Stone is great, however, as Bella. The supporting cast is generally good, including Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe and Ramy Youssef, although I would not necessarily say any of them uniquely stand out. What does stand out within the confines of the narrative, however, is the film's stunning production design of fantastical Victorian Europe, which is stunning to look at and combines a variety of unique aesthetic choices and color palettes to great success. The film probably didn't need to be nearly two and a half hours long, and some scenes feel a bit dragged out or lacking in purpose, yet the outrageous and blackly comic tone accentuated by the bold stylistic choices on display here make the film a worthwhile viewing experience. Recommended to those okay with graphic sexual material. 7/10."

So if somehow somebody of the organizers of the festival see this, I'm so grateful, it was a special night and even the idiots in the public couldn't ruin it for me. That's what we should see in Bulgarian cinemas. Anyway, now to the point.One is certain, this is a movie that is not just one of the hottest and most successful films of the year, but a movie that instantly becomes part of cinematic history. It's so beautiful and accurate in capturing a person's development and clashing with the world. I won't be able to describe the professional means used to accomplish the whole experience, but ones you see it, it's impossible not to feel it. At the same time, the movie is definitely not pretentious in any way, regardless of the depths of the philosophical problems that it covers - live, death, faith, God, poverty, social classes, inequality of sexes, trauma, love and etc. It is so normal in its own abnormality which for me is making it so special and close to my heart. And, of course, the humor. Don't know if there is such a thing as your type of humor, but if it exists, this definitely is mine. And everything is brought to life(literally in this case) by these talented, talented people - the actors.I'm sure this type of movie will bring broad audience among which way more eloquent and experienced people than me who will have something more appropriate to say about the movie(not to mention the critics reviews that are already available), but I believe that shouldn't stop me from trying to express what something so special made me feel and think about.

He's definitely a \"twisted mind,\" overindulging in the fisheye effect, but that doesn't detract from the film's brilliance.In short, Willem Dafoe is someone like Dr. Frankenstein, who even physically resembles the doctor's creation from the classic films. Here, he has created... Emma Stone - a beautiful woman with a baby's brain transplanted into her, and she's just starting to explore the world. The first part is quite dark, black and white, repellent, often resorting to the mentioned fisheye. Everything changes when the heroine awakens her sexual sensuality and begins to experience reality through it. Suddenly, the film becomes richly colorful and even funny. Throughout, it maintains its intelligent humor, shining in every scene, with the main focus being the questioning the postulates of the world surrounding the characters (something like the end of the 19th or early 20th century, but with many elements of steampunk) through the unburdened consciousness of a child in a woman's body.I generally have reservations about Lanthimos's aesthetics, often crossing certain boundaries. And it's present here, but in moderate doses, mainly in the beginning. But the fact that I was charmed by the film despite my reservations should speak even more. I believe it should win not only the Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival but also any Golden Globes, Oscars, or whatever else is up to be grabbed this season. And Emma Stone, too. Definitely a 10/10 rating, which I don't give that often."

There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very \"risky\" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, \"Never go full stupid\", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, \"Alright, I get it.\"Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."

                "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is possibly the most divisive director working today. Movie goers tend to either love his films like THE FAVOURITE (2018), THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017), THE LOBSTER (2015), and DOGTOOTH (2009) or walk away baffled that any decent human being could enjoy such dark works of strangeness and oddity. Despite this, two of his films have received Oscar nominations, and this latest may be both his most accessible and most outrageous project yet. It's also a rare outing where Lanthimos left the writing to others. His co-writer on THE FAVOURITE, Tony McNamara (\"The Great\") has adapted the screenplay from the 1992 novel by renowned Scottish writer Alasdair Gray, whose tome was influenced by Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\".Oscar winner Emma Stone delivers a truly remarkable (and physically demanding) performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet Bella, she has the mind and coordination of a toddler in an adult woman's body ... the product of Dr. Godwin Baxter (you can call me God), played by Willem Dafoe. God is a surgeon-slash-mad scientist, his own scarred body the result of experiments conducted by his father. God is both doctor and monster. Although various animal blends (ducks, chickens, dogs, etc) roam the premises, it is Bella who is clearly God's most treasured production. Her reanimation process and backstory are spelled out in the movie.Bella develops daily, and when Godwin's lawyer, Duncan Wedderbum (Mark Ruffalo) shows up to take care of some business, he is intrigued by Bella and offers to take her on an adventure ... one that ultimately spans Lisbon to Paris, and a luxury cruise ship to a brothel. Duncan and Bella engage in \"furious jumping\" (her phrase for sex) and soon her libido is quite advanced, and her river of independence flows freely, turning Duncan into a whiny buffoon. This story, Bella's story, is really about a woman finding her own way in a world where men try to control/manager her. It's fascinating to see her hyper curiosity about the world and her surroundings. On top of that, Bella is often quite direct and unfiltered in her statements.The humor here is frequent and unconventional as evidenced by Bella being described as \"a beautiful retard\", and the stream of deadpan one-liners. Still, the message comes across loudly and clearly as we marvel at Bella and Emma Stone's performance. I hesitate to use the word fearless (unless it's Tom Cruise) since it's just acting, but the word applies to Ms. Stone here. Supporting work comes from Christopher Abbott, Margaret Qualley, Ramy Yussef, Jarrod Carmichael, Hannah Schygulla, and Kathryn Hunter, while Mark Ruffalo revels in flashing his comedic chops.Cinematographer Robbie Ryan interjects black and white for effect and makes good use of the fish-eye lens. Production Designers James Price and Shona Heath get creative with set pieces, especially the cruise ship and brothel, and Costume Designer Holly Waddington nearly steals the spotlight with Bella's outfits, which are always a bit exaggerated. The music adds a specific element and works quite well, and there is a truly awesome dance scene. Yorgos Lanthimos again earns the title Master of Strangeness with this outlandish film with bits from Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Young Frankenstein (a common thread). The film is somehow both extremely funny and severely disturbing, and is an example of good people trying to come to grips with the realization that people often do bad things. My only complaint is the film features what are possibly the worst closing credits ever.Opening in theaters on December 8, 2023."

                "content": "Poor Things is a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating film, offering a unique blend of dark humor, social commentary, and gothic romance. Director Yorgos Lanthimos, known for his bizarre and unsettling films like The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, delivers another distinctive and thought-provoking work.Emma Stone shines as Bella Baxter, portraying her transformation from a naive child to a defiant woman with captivating charm and depth. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Mark Ruffalo delivering a memorable performance as the eccentric scientist and Olivia Colman adding her usual comedic flair.The film's visuals are captivating, featuring meticulously crafted sets and costumes that evoke the Victorian era with a touch of the surreal. The use of color, lighting, and cinematography is masterful, creating a visually stunning and immersive world for the characters to inhabit.Lanthimos' signature dark humor is present throughout the film, often used to satirize societal norms and challenge traditional gender roles. While some may find the humor unsettling or uncomfortable, it effectively complements the film's themes and adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.The film's central themes of identity, societal expectations, and female empowerment are explored through Bella's journey of self-discovery. As she encounters prejudice and discrimination, she learns to challenge the status quo and forge her own path. While the message may be delivered with a heavy dose of Lanthimos' signature absurdity, it resonates deeply and leaves a lasting impression.However, the film is not without its flaws. The narrative can feel uneven at times, with some scenes dragging on and others feeling rushed. Additionally, the film's ending may leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied or confused.Overall, Poor Things is a compelling and challenging film that pushes the boundaries of traditional filmmaking. It is not a film for everyone, as its dark humor and bizarre elements may be off-putting to some viewers. However, for those who appreciate Lanthimos' unique style and are willing to engage with its complex themes, Poor Things is a rewarding experience offering a stimulating and unforgettable cinematic journey."

However, this might have been the best film he's done so far. Emma Stone is a scene stealer. If she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination for this role, I'd be stunned. Stunning set design, cinematography, use of colors, and overall, fantastic story on feminism. Highly recommend this to anyone, though I feel most people would either love this or hate this. Plenty of laughs, but also plenty of endearing moments that truly make you think. Yorgos is an auteur, and I look forward to his future films."

Her uncivilized behavior discussing others sexual habits, threatening to punch babies, and encouraging any child like behavior from others was amusing and also beautiful to watch as people gravitated towards her openness and honesty.Before anything 'Poor Things' is outrageously funny and doesn't overshadow its poignant message of female empowerment and personal freedoms. It's a perfect balance between humor and meaningful themes.With its masterful storytelling, it's an easy front runner for the year's best. All around great performances from the cast with Emma Stone being the obvious standout performance."

The fact that they some things in this film are just so interesting and the way the capture Bella's growth as a character is just all to the screenwriter Tony McNamara.

The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."

                "content": "Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and \"The Holdovers\" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.\"The Holdovers\" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and \"The Holdovers\" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is \"The Holdovers.\" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."

As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given.

But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (\"You hit him? You mean you punched him out?\" \"No, I hit him with a car...\") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun.

It follows the experiences of the \"holdovers,\" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).\"The Holdovers\" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. \"The Holdovers\" is a great Christmas movie."

Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way \"Harold and Maude\" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"

                "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is \"Discomfort and Joy\", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. \"Entre nous\" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."

Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the \"I like this\" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a \"field trip\" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into \"oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great\" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was \"whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?\" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."

And it seems to feel the same way about me.\" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled \"vermin,\" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, \"I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.\"Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.\"Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer....\" Paul Hunham."

Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 \"holdovers\", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (\"Sideways\", \"The Descendants\"). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.\"The Holdovers\" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people).

While an American director, his films (usually) stayed away from the typical American predictable, simplistic, good guy/ bad guy stereotypes and easy solutions.The Holdovers has an interesting premise and interesting main characters: a nerdy history teacher, a troubled student and a sad cook. The depiction of high cost private boarding schools is pretty realistic and the characters are well contoured. There are some clever dialogues and some intelligently constructed scenes. The plot keeps one engaged from one end to another of the film.Having said that, one leaves the cinema with the nagging feeling that this was not quite what one expects from Mr. Payne. In my opinion, he \"sold out\" to mainstream American cinema. The bad guys are really bad; the good guys, well, God bless them. There are some \"deus ex machina\" solutions (a helicopter landing on campus - really?) and the eventual explanations for everything going on was quite contrived and simplistic, in the good ol' Hollywood tradition.A good film for a Netflix evening - definitely.Something Mr. Payne can put on his resume along \"Sideways\" and \"About Smith\" - not so much.PS: The film is rated R. Why? Because there are a few swear words and some people smoking and drinking?"

That was not surprising because it's a heartwarming crowdpleasing film and one of Payne's best. It reunites Payne with Paul Giamatti who starred in the director's 2005 film \"Sideways.\" Giamatti and Da'Vine Joy Randolph are superb and Dominic Sessa in his film debut is a brilliant find. Set during the holiday season in 1970 at a New England boarding school with a side trip to Boston \"The Holdovers\" shows how human connections that may seem unlikely can be transformative."

Told through a once in a lifetime acting performance from Paul Giamatti who portrays the perfect role of the hated history teacher, Dominic Sessa, who is just a young boy trying to have a Christmas break like every other young boy, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph, a grieving woman who misses her family.As the story progresses, we experience a beautiful two weeks that the 3 main characters are stuck on together. The story develops and we start to know more about their personal lives, their experiences, and who they really are as individuals.I can't put into words how enjoyable, comedic, and heart warming these 3 weeks were, told in a runtime of 2 hours 13 mins. The customs, make up & hairstyle, interior & exterior design, soundtrack, and the cinematography that made the film look like it was shot using an old camera. These elements were all able to portray the vintage vibe of 1970."

                "content": "Saw this on its limited release at the Alamo Drafthouse in Downtown LA--one of Alexander Payne's best, and easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. That said, the story and the plot is simplicity itself, and not all that remarkable or new--it's in the execution that the whole crew hits it out of the park. Now as if my own voice as an academic isn't pretentious enough, here's channeling the POV of a stuck-up film critic from my next life:Been a fan of Payne from the beginning--I remember driving all the way to Omaha Nebraska in the middle of one of those thick midwestern fogs to catch ABOUT SCHMIDT in the theatre--so I was favorably predisposed towards the movie, not to mention towards Paul Giamatti as well after seeing him in SIDEWAYS. But the story and the movie still had to earn my trust--which it did by the time the young lead, Dominic Sessa, appeared in his initial scenes. Giamatti was funny as the teacher (some would call him cranky but I would only call him real, having taught for more than twenty years myself)--but Dominic really sold the character of Angus because watching him I was reminded of my nephew a lot who also happens to be in high school right now.Again, the plot is simplicity itself: Dominic who plays high school student Angus ends up staying over on campus between terms because his mom and stepfather switch plans at the last minute, opting to go on their honeymoon instead of staying home for the holidays. To watch over Angus two adults stay over at school too--the aforementioned teacher Paul (essayed by Giamatti) and the cook (played by Da' Vine Joy Randolph of MURDERS IN THE BUILDING fame). The latter, a single mother, also just lost her son in Vietnam. With these three main characters in the mix--admittedly very different from each other--the movie's magic is about how the drama and even comedy develops organically as a result. The fineness of execution I mentioned earlier is key here--everything works so well for us precisely because very little is overblown.Must mention that I was slightly disappointed to learn this was shot digitally with film grain added later--but I understand the choice better now after hearing the DP discuss the matter in a Cinematography podcast, where he explained how they experimented with shooting on film at first, but then realized that they would have to alter things in post-production anyway given the \"70s film look\" they were going for."

Let me just say, Alexander Payne did a wonderful job bringing back teenage school movies with coming-of-age films from the '70s into the modern era. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew it was going to be a wonderful time watching it! It has so many good jokes and brilliantly written one-liners in it! It's got a great sense of heart with comedy, and without spoiling the ending, it has deep and profound relationships with the cast.This movie wasn't shot on a soundstage; it was filmed at five Massachusetts academies to depict its fictional New England boarding school, Barton Academy. Filming began in Massachusetts on January 27, 2022. The crew filmed on location at Groton, Northfield Mount Hermon, Deerfield Academy, St. Mark's School, and Fairhaven High School. Director Alexander Payne doesn't disappoint. Comparing it to some of my other favorite films he's directed, such as \"Nebraska\" and \"The Descendants,\" which were also excellent! This was shot on a very unique film stock as well, giving it a very vintage '70s appeal. Payne has mentioned that he took inspiration for making this movie from films like \"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,\" the movie \"IF,\" and another feature called \"Merlusse.\"This movie will tug at your heart at the end and make you laugh from the beginning. This movie was tailor-made specifically for Paul Giamatti, and it doesn't disappoint. I don't want to spoil the ending for people; go check it out yourselves. I wasn't expecting this movie to end the way it did; that's all I will say. But it is deep and full of impressive emotion, dealing with some very challenging things I wasn't expecting from this movie. I will say this movie is for an older audience but is young at heart. A pleasure to see Alexander Payne and Paul Giamatti work together again!"

                "content": "Set in December 1970, \"The Holdovers\" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as \"Sideways,\" \"The Descendants,\" and \"Nebraska,\" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So \"The Holdovers\" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."

Something of that manner.All fine things to borrow from.I'm happy to report that it doesn't take from those amazing works but instead stands on its own in its own fantastic way for the entire running time of over two hours.I dig the opening 1970's titles and credits.The vibe remains throughout in glorious interior and exterior shots.Excellent soundtrack of the era with Badfinger, Cat Stevens and Guy Lombardo among many, many others.The sounds float around this story of a people in their own time.In the beginning, you are unsure of where this is going or when it might get going.Is this thing going to take off like The Breakfast Club?Are we going to have on-campus shenanigans?Or will it be like The Last Detail? Maybe an escape into the city from this institution of learning or some sort of road trip or something?But the fun is in all of the characters.This is about people.Alone in a time of gathering and are left to themselves to gather.It is beautiful in that way.This is about tremendous loss.This is about never having.This is about the beginning of adulthood but it is also about realizing you're far beyond the middle of it.I love all of the casual cigarette smoking and hard alcohol consumption.This is the commencement of the 1970's.This movie is also about losing what little you have and making sacrifices.It's a lovely message.Especially around the holidays."

He's a total disgrace as a teacher and as a human.He's charged with caring for a group of kids whose parents lived in an era before legal abortion was an option so they did the next best thing: they sent their unwanted offspring off to boarding school. The fact that they can't even be bothered with their kids at Christmas really drives home the argument for Planned Parenthood and all of its services.Old professor Crabby is not fun and wants to turn the holiday weeks into a juvie prison. In a desperate attempt to add balance and humor to the already foundering ship of this movie, they bring aboard the sassy Black lunch lady. Did I mention she has a dead son? Viet Nam. None of this matters because the lunch lady can't keep this thing afloat and she mostly sits it out on the sidelines smoking and drinking.The kid mouths off to a working-class guy playing pinball. Unlikely that some skinny little rich twerp would do that.Sorry, but a couple of off-hand Latin aphorisms isn't the same thing as a good script.Lots of time with no really big moments.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray\" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews. Like, what were you watching!?"

Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary."

First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Regardless, fans of The Hunger Games will likely watch this movie anyway."

I don't know what to expect from here on out, but I hope to be as entertained, if not more, by the original movies of the series.The story was engaging and separated into three parts that made it enjoyable. Everything from the introduction of the Games to evasions to conclusions were well executed. Despite the film being violent prone it still comes across as tense and deadly without showing anything too gruesome to maintain its PG rating.The acting was strong. The actors were well suited for their roles, and only based on trailers, I found the young Snow builds well for the original movies, but unknown for certain. I loved the chemistry between Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth.The music was terrific. Zegler has an amazing voice, and her songs obviously work well into the film. The visuals are mostly incredible. There's a few spots where it's very obviously screen acting. Part of me hopes they did have physical sets cause there were portions that felt genuine.Overall, you don't need to have seen the previous films to understand what's going on, but it may help to better understand who the characters are. Acting is strong, music is great, and the story is amazing enough to make me want to see the rest of \"The Hunger Games\".That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"

None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time."

The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment."

No crying, no betrayal, no epilogue, no letter? Nothing??? It was so anti-climactic! Like she never even existed!But then Highbotton's words rang clear: mystery has a way of driving people mad. If we the audience were this frustrated, imagine just how delirious it must've made Snow. She could've outed him, betrayed him, stood up to him, maybe even messaged him- he must've searched for her if just to get rid of the last loose end (before he became too powerful to even bother with this anymore, of course), but he found absolutely nothing! Nothing to chase, nothing to hate, nothing to even confirm that it was real other than his fading memories, white roses and a ghost of her who with the same spirit sings that damn song under the hanging tree.I can't help but think that what if she'd stayed? He'd lied, and he had violence, and all those other bad things in his being already, but the only thing that was keeping him from going through that door was Lucy gray. It doesn't excuse nor explain his action (not even by the slightest) but I can't help but wonder if she'd stayed, would he still turn out that way? Not necessarily the whole tyrannical dictator coming into power stuff- but fundamentally could he have become a better human being? Could he have changed? And was her departure his sign to finally cave in, or was he going to turn out like that anyway?Also the hunger games were freaking crazy I loved every second of it, favorite part of the movie.

                "content": "I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, \"What am I missing?\" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, \"There's more?\" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10 Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."

This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12."

It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a \"mentor\" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10."

Probably the biggest problem is that none of the main characters seem likable or realistic enough in the world for me to root for them or have the emotional down-spiral of the characters to be a good tragic drama.There is sort of this 1950s steampunk aesthetic that also made no sense to me given that this is supposed to take place in our distance future rather than the somewhat recent past. How/why would TVs in the future start to become anything like TV screens from the 50s? Are they also going to reinvent laserdiscs?The way the hunger games unfolds makes it feel completely absurd that the winner would win even with all of the cheating. Also the 2 big dramatic scenes after the games just seems confusing. Especially intermixed with some of the other scenes around them. Maybe he works better with all of the perspectives and time that an author is given in a book. But it certainly didn't make a lot of sense to me.Stumbling across the guns later in the film seemed way too coincidental too. And the motivations of the main characters was so inconsistent from one moment to the next near the end that he started to seem bipolar and phycho. I don't think they sufficiently developed his character so one could understand why/how he would work so hard for power and control. The beginning had him challenged that power and control so much that it was a wonder why he would even want any power and control over a society that he just barely seemed to care about.All in all. It's a mess, but interesting to try to follow because it seems to be such a mess.The actors seemed alright. The music was good. The cinematography was fine. But the story and characters didn't seem well developed to me. And I was frequently wondering why these characters and this timeline was being presented given that it didn't seem to answer many questions compare to all the questions and problems it raised."

the direction on a microscale was bad as the interpersonal scenes did not feel fluid at all and were not well executed; the direction of actors was bad as none of of the performances felt like they were elevated by direction; storytelling was poor as there doesn't feel like a sense of where the movie is going as builds to one thing and drastically disposes of it in favor of a something else), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Tom Blyth (Shows some range of emotion and shows both the good and the bad side of Snow decently well), Pretty Bad from Rachel Zegler (Her accent kept on slipping and she kinda feels out of place with the rest of the cast (and the chemistry between her and Blyth is not the best); her musical moments (while forced) were carried out well as she shows off how good of a singer she is), Pretty Good from Peter Dinklage (Really just feels like he is playing many of the characters he has played in the past (the drunk character who has a lot to say) so he kinda just goes on his own), Good from Jason Schwartzman (The best performance of the movie as he plays the comedic relief character well), Pretty Bad from Hunter Schafer (Very emotionless and doesn't have any emotion with Blyth), Decent from Josh Andrés Rivera (Has moments where he shines and some moments where it feels like he's overacting), Decent from Viola Davis (Not really her best performance as it is a lot of overacting (but it doesn't feel like it is a bad performance, just not the best direction)), Decent from the rest of the cast (Hard to comment as most of the cast is child actors who feel like they weren't given the best direction)), Bad Story (The concept was pretty good as it was interesting to see the early Hunger Games and the origins of President Snow (though the carrying out of this concept was very bad); the story contruction was terrible as first act drags so much that its boring and the third act is completely out of place as it felt like they forgot to make Snow the bad guy (the second act is pretty good as its just The Hunger Games and plays to the strengths of the franchise); storytelling/flow between sequences was bad as every scene just felt forced and nothing felt like it flowed between each other (and this is especially seen in the final act as the movie has to make up for making Snow be the good guy when hes supposed to be the bad guy; character writing was very bad (Snow is terribly written as they put so much emphasis on sympathiszing him and making him be the good guy that they run out of time in making him be the bad guy and rush/force this part of the character in the end, Lucy Gray Baird is not written either as you really don't cate about her as her singing just gets really annoying towards the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue did not flow and was kinda forced; the tension build was good and carried out well in The Hunger Games act; the symbolism was very shallow as it does not do a good job in building Snow's journey for power; the foreshadowing was none-existent as the movie forces the ending because they forgot to make Snow the bad guy in the first two acts), Good Score (Carries different motifs from the original franchise), Good Cinematography (Helped show how grand the capital was and helped build the world (especially in The Hunger Games)), Good Sound (Helped in the action scenes), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helped make the movie feel like it was a part of the franchise and did not feel over-the-top in any way), Good Production Design (Helped with building the world), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as 2 out of the three acts were pointless (the first act builds Snow to be a good guy and really drags, the second act is pretty good as it is just The Hunger Games, and the third act is just so forced as it clearly shows that they forgot to make Snow the bad guys so they rush to give him moments that show how he's not a good person); The movie could've been split into two movies to help with runtime (with the entire third act being spun off to show how bad of a person Snow is as there are some moments in the second act that could allude to him being a bad guy, something a second movie could take and build on), Pacing was slow in the first and third act (especially in the third) but pretty good in the second act as the fast pace helped build tension in The Hunger Games, Climax was so underwhelming it was more laughable than entertaining, Tone was very similar to other Hunger Games movies."

None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters.

They were a good transposition of the books.With this one I was waiting impatiently for the end.Performances felt a little bit off, as off felt the dialogues. However the main problem to me is the lack of a central idea. It is not clear if they wanted to show a specific edition of the hunger games, if they wanted to explore Lucy and the other tributes, if they wanted to tell the story from Snow's perspective or if they wanted to explain how the modern hunger game came to life. The film it's all over the places, characters are not explored nor do they make an effort to allow the viewer to empathize with them, they're so empty and unlikable.If this is not enough they even sing. Lucy Grey straight out from the arena, after seeing the death of 24plus people is on a stage singing like a mermaid. And the singing goes on and on to the point where I can confidently sai that the last 30 minutes the film become a musical.The only likable character is portrayed by Dinklage and he dies."

I read the original trilogy but never got around to reading the prequel but decided to just see the movie. Rachel Zegler receives hate because of a comment she made about a completely different movie (Snow White), and it's completely irrelevant to this movie. She performed more than beautifully in this role. She is a classically trained soprano, and was singing beautifully in her chest voice and with a really good twangy accent (which is more of a mezzo/alto type of singing in this case). From one classically-trained singer with a degree in music who performs for a living to everyone out there afraid to give this movie a chance because of all of this biases against this young woman- SHE IS GOOD! This girl is talented, and the hate is stupid.This movie was by no means perfect, but it was really good. I would have thought it was a perfect 10 if the action was better paced. It was nothing on her part. Definitely not as good as Catching Fire (the peak of the series to me), but better than both of the Mockingjays!

This prequel focuses on Snow's beginnings as a humble young man who questions the methods that the Capitol uses to discipline the rebels, but throughout the film he discovers the truth about what human beings are capable of. All through his relationship with Lucy Gray hoping to regulate the methods of the Capitol. Unlike the previous films, this is a longer and more dramatic story that does not focus solely on the Hunger Games, but mostly on Snow's transmission. It is a worthy installment that serves as a prologue to the saga, even without the presence of Katniss Everdeen. It has that metaphorical characteristic that has always defined the saga with respect to capitalism, social inequality and what human beings are capable of doing by instinct. Rachel Zegler gives a spectacular performance in many ways, including her musical numbers. There is no doubt that The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a great film that revives the saga again and is a good option for those who do not know the saga to begin to enter this apocalyptic universe created by Suzanne Collins. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10."

Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come one!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater.

Acting was okay but none of the actors had chemistry, the stakes didn't feel very high at any point, and the singing was both excessive and borderline comical in timing. The movie preached many times that viewers need someone to root for and someone to hate, whilst simultaneously doing the exact opposite by giving us neither.What made the original Hunger Games great was that you believed in the characters backstories, and you could get drawn into it. Snow and Casca felt real, but everyone else somehow felt like a caricature of a person. Kudos to both of these actors who did a phenomenal job, it just somehow wasn't cohesive with the other characters who felt somewhat 2-dimensional.Lucy in particular felt over-acted and I struggled to root for her - the chemistry with Snow falling particularly flat. Did I mention the singing was insanely overdone? In contrast, the brief screen time that Clemensia and Snow shared felt far more genuine and intriguing, and I would've liked to understand her and Snow's friendship more.Overall the movie felt messy and lacking in heart. I had been so excited for this movie for so long and was disappointed at how disconnected it felt. Whilst I understand that singing is woven throughout the book, this felt like one of those things that in a movie felt out of place. Perhaps it was the way it was acted, I'm not sure, but even as low budget as the 1st Hunger Games movie was.... I felt connected to the characters and their journey, which was not the case here."

                "content": "Wish is a funny, perhaps unfortunate title for this movie. When its trailer came out, and people commented on how its \"storybook illustrations come to life\" visual style looked more like unfinished 3D animation than moving drawings, you bet there were puns aplenty about how this is just \"Spider-Verse from Wish\" -- or, more aptly, \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish from Wish\" but that one sounds a bit clunky.Indeed, for all the talk of how Wish would be a grand return for Disney Fairy Tales™ that also, I guess to commemorate Disney's centennial, would somehow \"personify\" the wishing star we see in many of their films, the reception wasn't exactly across-the-board ecstatic. On top of how weird the animation looked to people -- which is odd since we know Disney can nail 2D-looking 3D, as with 2013's The Paperman -- several critics remarked on how a lot of the post-2010 Disney movies (Pixar, too) reduce themselves to \"Pick a culture to explore; make generational trauma the villain\" and, more importantly, have interchangeable adorkable/awkward/\"quirky\" female protagonists that oft sound more like Millennial YouTubers than fairy tale heroines.Ever since Tangled, the new \"princesses\" have tried to replicate the vibe of Mandy Moore's Rapunzel on some level. Wish also exemplifies that weird trend of post-Tangled Disney/Pixar films of having one-word titles that don't sound very whimsical or exciting. (Kudos to DALLEE 3: It tends to get this right when generating fake posters for \"Pixar's *INSERT HISTORICAL ATROCITY HERE*\".) If they ever adapt H. C. Andersen's The Princess and the Pea, mark my words that it'll just be named Pea.The plot: The ruler of the Mediterranean kingdom of Rosas, King Magnifico, has the magical ability to keep the \"wishes\" of the populace in his custody to grant/return as he sees fit; each citizen has to give theirs up as they come of age. His new apprentice, Asha, senses that evil is afoot and discovers that she is able to make wishes irrespective of the king's approval, turning towards the stars and even summoning a sentient wishing star named... Star. And yes, the plushie should be in stores now.Ariana DeBose, Chris Pine, and Alan Tudyk, who naturally plays the comic animal sidekick, are all fairly funny in their roles from time to time and I may even have vibed with one of the songs. Sadly, my verdict mirrors the one that everyone else seems to have: I will not be remembering this movie in a few weeks, beyond the myriad jokes at its expense.I suppose the Wish situation might partly be explained by the awakening that's been happening all throughout 2023, where mainstream movies get to be truly good and artful again, and so people realize that Disney's films may not be all that interesting -- and, moreover, may not be worth defending under pretenses of activism. We are more aware than ever that options exist. Even if you truly refuse to bring back 2D animation and opt to meet people halfway by making a sort of 2D-3D hybrid, we can find more seamless attempts in such movies as Klaus (which is also a better call-back to older Disney designs than this is) and, like I said, the Spider-Verse films.I do think people act a bit dismissive toward the picture, and there are things to appreciate in it -- particularly its storybook opening sequence that mimics the typography of the one from Snow White; other images recall the likes of Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Pocahontas, etc. Alas, I think the best version of the movie was lost to another timeline where less corporate meddling took place. (Did I mention that the songs were written, not by someone with experience in musicals, but by a person who's written songs for Justin Bieber?)We should also give Wish this, however: It made droves of people, be they fans (the thinking, non-zealous kind) or film critics, truly appreciate what this studio used to give us, especially during the Disney Renaissance -- from the superior emotional resonance of the songs to the heavy stakes and grandiloquent visuals (most notably in Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame), not to mention the variety of the 2D-animated styles compared to now, when most of the movies look like they inhabit pretty much the same universe.If you want a true celebration of Disney's magic over the past century 'til now, I'd rather you check out the Disney+ short Once Upon A Studio (which I managed to enjoy despite being reminded not two days later of what Disney has become, as they announced another slew of remakes, even one of effing Frozen). Asha, the latest addition to the world of Disney princesses, joining hands with Snow White, the first-ever of the princesses, is significantly more poetic and moving than anything in Wish."

There are some good musical instrumental backgrounds as well. I do appreciate that the story isn't based on a sequel, remake or something that already exists and Disney tries to introduce new characters and settings. But the issue is that the narrative is way too familiar from other stories and it lacks the creativity, energy and charm of the good old Disney princess movies which makes it pretty difficult to fully engage with emotionally or to care for. The lack of energy and bland style causes the characters to not be investing as well since none of the characters were engaging or interesting at all. However, the voice performances from the cast members are pretty good. Ariana DeBose and Chris Pine both provided really good voice performances. Including Alan Tudyk as Tudyk is great as usual with his voice works.The animation, as I mentioned, it's solid as the design models, colors, and movements are pretty good. With the animation using a mix of computer and watercolor, there are some really nice moments but admittedly, there were some animated movements or looks that felt odd, bland and slightly distracting. The dialogue is pretty clunky, the direction was boring, and the singing or musical moments, despite one or two songs being not too bad, the singing and song-writing wasn't good as some of the sound felt like it was written from AI. Like some of the voice and singing sound effects were pretty off. And as a whole, it was mostly boring.For this being the 100th Anniversary movie for Disney, it's quite embarrassing since there could have been any other movie that could have been pretty fun and all but it seemed Disney decided to go with the bland route.Overall, children and families will be entertained but this one is definitely one of Disney's weaker movies."

But as of late, each Disney project has come to feel like a rehash of every other Disney project; slowly killing any amount of excitement one might have looking forward to each new project.Wish is no different and is as every bit forgettable and uninspiring as people are accusing it of being. If there's anything worth remembering though, it would have to be the watercolor-esque art style, but not even that justifies the movie's existence. Wish lacks depth and is painfully a face-value movie. It has a Disney-protagonist, a Disney-antagonist, a Disney-merch mascot, some Disney-music, and well yea, that's about it.The question though, is if kids would enjoy it. After all, that's who the movie is primarily aimed at. And the answer might be 'yes', but probably at a level no different than how they might enjoy say Cocomelon or something. There's nothing magical that might stand out and nothing that might inspire. It's yet another Disney showcase of good animation with less than nothing else to accommodate."

I expected the struggle to grant everyone's wishes would lead to undesired outcome that the girl would have to fix. In doing so becoming the villain herself as her selfishness would have brought disaster and I thought the king would be proved right and the girl's selfishness would lead to the king sacrificing himself to save everyone. Teaching the girl a lesson about stealing and maintain order. It would have been a good twist if the initial villain ended up being the good guy after all and the girls action would make her the villain. Then there could have been a redemption arc for her in the final act. The Star could have been some type of neutral being that ended up becoming evil due to all the negative wishes overpowering the good wishes. Then there could have been that one pure heart wish that overpowered all the bad wishes and restoring the stars position to either neutral or good. The premise was there. It could have been so good. But none of that happened.In this movie the girl is perfect she cannot do any wrong. She has no hero's journey. Everyone in the story is perfect except the main villain and he wouldn't have been corrupted if not for the girls actions. What she did to him was basically entrapment. I lesson I got from this movie is stealing is ok if it's for family. No one is capable of making bad wishes. Which is not true. If I was or anyone had the power to grant wishes we too would be worried about handing out wishes like candy. I think any one with common sense would know how dangerous that can be. What ever happened to the old school Disney movies That had consequences for your actions. Those were some real lessons. The queens actions in the end are criminal. The king never imprisoned any one. He never robbed them of their freedom but she did. She basically sentenced him to die. For guarding wishes.The star thing was cute tho. That thing is going to sell merchandise. The animation was good. The songs won't be classics. They're forgettable. The only characters that have good design are the king and the star."

He's empty enough that you can imagine him as an analogue for whatever politician you dislike.The supporting cast was a pile of generic stock characters. Ably enough acted, but utterly forgettable. None were developed enough to be interesting.The music is lively, but instantly forgettable. After Frozen, Tangled, and Moana, my kids sang garbled toddler versions of the songs on the ride home. After Wish? Nothing. Not even a hum.The art was interesting. The watercolor-ish style worked for the backgrounds, and captured some of the feel of classic Disney films. But the characters seemed crudely pasted atop the background. More than any recent Disney film, you could FEEL the computers behind the animation.The plot was uninspired. There were a handful of places where the writers could have taken different paths, and asked interesting questions about the nature of power and responsibility, but they abandoned them in favor of a one-dimensional and utterly predictable story.Even the worst flops in the Disney archives had something going for them. Brother Bear was beautiful, Home on the Range was funny, and Dinosaur was a technological leap forward. Wish has nothing. Was it terrible? No. Was it memorable? Definitely not. Will anyone bother to see it more than once? I doubt it."

It doesn't manage to spark into life, arguably the most forgettable Disney characters to date.I've read several comments about the animation, and plenty seem to applaud the style, quality and colours, let me be honest, this sucks, the most basic and unimaginative animation I think I've seen, to me it looks unfinished, did they get it out in a rush, or were there budget cuts, this isn't Disney standard, let alone a Centenary special.I genuinely fear for Disney, everything they're touching seems to be going to pot, they need a major shake up, Snow White doesn't look like a classic, where do Disney go from this?Woeful.4/10."

After all those years hammering the message into our heads, they have forgotten it themselves! And that is one of the many issues with Wish. There's no love interest, and we, the audience, lose interest.Maybe we shouldn't. Maybe we should appreciate that love for your grandpa and your mom is enough, and that friendship with your buddies is equally important as passionate love. Or maybe Disney could make peace with love. When a young person loves another, it doesn't necessarily mean that they need to let go of their personality, ambitions, ideals or for that matter, wishes. Love can be, usually is, a good thing.Making an emotional story without love is not impossible, but it's hard. And the ingredients are not there in Wish. In the absence of love, humor can help. But the secondary characters in Wish, Valentino the goat or the mute lucky star, are not very good, and not funny at all. The music could help, but the songs aren't all that memorable. And the main characters, while decent, can't quite carry the story. Asha, a mix of Moana, Elsa and Pocahontas, is okay but she seems to lack a clear purpose that is believable, and we never really care much about her. Magnifico, the villain, may be the best character, but he feels so much like a rehash of other villains before him, that we struggle to see him as a character in his own right.Left without emotion, without humor, without great music, the film doubles down on weaponry, raising the stakes on the use of dark magic with every scene to try and keep the audience awake. But it's not enough. I dozed off a few times.My advice to Disney: make love, not war."

It's as if they had to reach a deadline so put in the minimal effort necessary to get it finished, which left us with a hollow movie devoid of any magic, held together only by its mind-numbingly predictable narrative.I feel bad for those who worked hard on this film because this could have been a good movie if the studio just took the time to fill it with personality and character. Instead, Wish is a pretty lifeless addition to the Disney canon.Note: Apparently there has been a hate-train trashing this film trending all over TikTok. It is why my niece already had a well-formulated opinion on the film at Thanksgiving dinner without having even seen it.

I don't know why Disney animators can't create another Lion King or Little Mermaid or other engaging, fun movie. I remember taking my young kids to the annual Disney blockbuster movie - they were all excellent. But current creative staff aren't that creative and are making movies that nobody wants to see.The story is very generic and the songs, by pop singer-songwriter Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, are rather uninspiring. But I have to admit that DeBose and Pine performed the generic songs well. The only time Wish shines bright is when it dares to get a little bit odd. Asha wishes on a star for everyone in Rosas to get their wish (so that they can work toward making them come true for themselves), and a plump, wiggly and mischievous star pops out of the sky and pays her a visit, sprinkling stardust on plants and inanimate objects, bringing them to dancing, singing life.The real test was that my grandkids were bored instead of being inspired. Disney needs to get another group of animators who can go back to making fun, imaginative again."

While there are some cute moments, overall it just wasn't that great of a film. The plot was weak, didn't have a lot of likable characters, villain is kind of random, humor didn't land, the songs were meh for the most part, and the payoff just wasn't there. I didn't care for the overused \"im so awkward and quirky\" trope on the main character. Also, while I typically love Disney songs, a lot of the songs/lyrics felt super verbose. I read one review that said the songs sounded like they were generated using AI, and while I don't know if that's necessarily true, I can definitely see what they mean. Kids will like it, it's a decent family movie, but it's not anything I need to watch twice. In my opinion, Disney has set a pretty high standard with its past films (Ratatouille, Tangled, Cars, the list goes on and on) and this one doesn't even come close to that standard. Onward is way better than Wish, maybe check that one out instead if you haven't already and are in the mood for a Disney movie. Just my opinion! My bf and I both give this one a 6.5/10."

There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of \"showing\" the character beats like older films, we are \"told\" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring \"adorkable\" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no \"Be Our Guest,\" \"Part of your World,\" \"Let it Go\" or \"We Don't Talk about Bruno\".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song \"I'm a Star\" in the movie is \"in this universe we are all shareholders.\" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film."

It takes the formula of classic movies and then just places it in the movie just because. There's a ton of elements and parts of the movie that have little to no time to flesh it out. I legit didn't know who any of Asha's best friends were yet the movie wanted the betrayal scene to feel super massive. But it didn't feel like one, I just sat there and went \"Huh? What? He had plot significance?\" That was my reaction to a lot of the movie.My second reaction was \"UUUGH!\" It feels like the people behind the scenes cared more about the audience going \"oh hey it's (insert Disney movie)!\" instead of going \"Oh my gosh! What's gonna happen next in this movie?\" Every time I saw a Disney reference or a \"hidden\" Mickey, I was cringing on the inside. It wasn't smart. It was annoying.Speaking of annoying, I had a mild dislike for Asha. There's an excellent video online about the \"adorkable\" Disney princesses. Asha feels like how gen z kids picture millennials but cranked to 100. Every time she was rambling like \"Oh I'm sorry. I'm so annoying and I care too much! Am I annoying? Probably\" I wanted to stop watching the movie immediately cause I was just actually getting annoyed by it."

And the color that goes with it starts to feel like something out of Fantasia in terms of splendor and flow.-All in all, the animation still continues to prove Disney's elite level of making the unreal come to life in a way, and give us a treat for the eyes.The Voice Work -Animation relies on voice actors to bring characters to life, and our crew has managed to bring a cornucopia of talent that helps this feat.-Tudyk is still as fun as ever. His versatility is incredible, this time making a baby goat with a smooth velvety voice his primary objective. He accomplished much with his direction, delivering some great lines to appeal to many ages.-Pine sounds like, well Pine. His voice is perfect for the illustrious king, very poignant, charming, exciting, and yet still holding hints of rough nature. He pretty much is playing a generic Disney role and doesn't quite have the flair, but also is no slouch.-DeRose as Asha is great. A modern princess take, with a sensational voice that shows control over emotion, pitch, and delivery, I liked the work she granted the latest princess.The Design -It's an odd style, but I liked the blend of 2d and 3d animation styles into this hybrid granting an almost cell-shaded game like approach.-It holds the smooth movements of computer, but the color and energy of the original 2-D style and I think it accomplishes much for the presentations this movie chose.-Is it weird? Yes! In a way though, it works, as a sort of catch all to help make things pop for all the styles integrated into this movie.The Music Songs Themselves... Mostly -Disney has proven they can make a big soundtrack with songs that top the charts in sales. Wish is another success, to some degree, in my book.-A style that feels one part rock opera and another part theatrical stage show, the movie has plenty of that composer feel to it and perhaps the more unique aspect of the film.-Ballads are powerful and expressive of their dreams, catchy and yet beautiful at the same time. While other songs hold more engagement with their visual numbers than the song alone.-The product is another collection of good numbers that may be more of the focus and goal than the story itself, but one in which avid Disney music lovers will fall and repeat for years to come.The Inspiration -Perhaps heavier than other films, Wish is packed with a lot of things to teach the lessons to motivate the audience to do great things.-The story itself is a bit preachy on this, trying to rub it in my face the importance of dreams and how to make them come true.-However, I appreciate the lesson, despite the presentation, and found that some of the other character arcs at least tried to tie to this and help push the story.-Add in the theatrical music and the animated drawing holding such powerful control of emotions, and I felt they accomplished the inspirational tone they were seeking.Star: -The ultimate merchandising in this movie, the cute little character is my favorite one of the film.-For not saying anything, the little guy has a lot of heart and character, his emoting by far some of the cutest aspects I've seen in a while and somehow the most diverse of the group.-He does so much with his little form, knitting, pranking, and somehow inspiring himself, he is an adorable movie wrapped in a small bundle, one to surely be exploited by the House of Mouse.The Easter Eggs -The movie is a big homage to the history of the studio, and well... it's probably the biggest focus of this movie, or at least bigger than they imagined.-Disney lovers are going to love finding all the references and inspiration in this movie, cameos galore sprinkled throughout for one to see, or in many cases listen, to what the writers wished to acknowledge.-Even the credits pay homage to the magic of the studios and what came before, a stunning finish with a song that helps add the ambience to fans like me who love the cartoons released over the 100 years.-And the End Credit scene holds a weighted tribute to the man who started it all, and while not necessarily the most mind blowing, it does soothe the heart and soul.DISLIKES:The Characters So Auxiliary -Outside of the goat and the star, most of the rest of the characters are rather plain, boring, and a dull reference and cultural card than anything else.-Most of the characters have a gimmick, but often used in the singing and comedic roles, with little else.-Given characters like Pumba, Mrs. Potts, and the Dwarves, you would think they can accomplish more than spitting out one-liners and a some very limited action moments that hold little weight.-Such a shame given the strong work that Disney was known for doing so long ago.Story -Outside of the inspiration, the story really doesn't hold any magic for me either.-A rather bland story of unoriginal tales, the unique factor is mediocre and just lacking the splendor the animation has.-I found the tale rushed, full of the bland challenges and weak development that really felt robbed like the wishes of the kingdom.-So much potential, but so lost to the music and hidden references that what we got was a quick, almost novella story that will be good for those with small attention spans.-Such a shame.Placement Of Music -Another gimmick feeling aspect, the music is again good, passionate, and magical, but the placement feels a very modern motif.-Previous films found the ideal place to put a song, or use it to convey thoughts, feelings, and storytelling that fans have dissected for years.-Wish felt like Frozen in a sense, lots of songs in one movie, weaker and filling space, seeming just odd to break out into song and dance. A little more tact might have made the song even more impressiveJokes Are Mediocre And Kiddish -What happened to the double entendre jokes, the clever puns and misunderstandings, or even the well-executed insults?-Wish has none of that for me. More so forced emotional delivery, kiddy emphasis on butts and spit, and sounding like a social media stars trying to quote a scene like the character and failing.-Only a few jokes escaped this style, but for the most part, I felt a lot of influencer vibes in the writing, which just isn't my style given the track record of this movie.Weaker Antagonist -This was sad given again the potential of Disney villains.-Maleficent, Scar, Gaston, and Rattigan, these and more had design, class, skills, and backing that made them so much fun to fight in the movies and games.-But Magnifico, outside of the design to look like his actor, is kind of lame. He's cunning sure, but that's it. No major groundbreaking moves, a rather tame use of his powers, and even a boring climactic fight did little to make him memorable.-It's not he's a bad character, just again, rushed and forgettable, lost in the flood of things crammed into about 80 minutes of actual movie.Overall Forgettable -The movie is unfortunately not the magnificent production this company promoted for the 100th anniversary.-It's a movie that feels too full of stuff, gimmicks, music, and references superseding the story and flow, to make a rather lacking film.-I see many of my friends enjoying this who are die hard Disney fans, young kids that are like them, or just all about singing songs and finding homage touching.-But for me, it needed more time, more planning, a better story and better use of these ideas to balance into the story and fully cast the Disney spell they can do.THE VERDICT: I'm sure you can guess, but Wish did not have the magic I had hoped it would have. While the animation and design are beautiful, and the voice acting helps bring some fun, the movie is really more about finding the hidden gems than actually telling that Disney feeling story. A rushed mess of mediocrity with weaker side characters, a boring antagonist and paying too many cards without planning, it feels like storytelling remains a tertiary objective for the House of Mouse.. At least the music, no matter how oddly placed, was able to maximize the inspiration and give you the hope that dreams can come true, just in time for the holiday season. Is this a go for the theater? In a way yes, the sound system does wonders for the music, and 3D could be fun as you ride the nostalgia with a star in the lead. But story and majestic wise... well... that might be best left for a home viewing.My scores are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 6.5-7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0."

When you place your hopes and dreams into the hands of a power greater than you, such as corporate Disney, you become a slave to what they want serving only to make them more powerful and you weaker.It's a bizarrely subversive hit on themselves and done in such a way as to not make it interesting or fun enough for repeat viewing or to sell toys which is an additional hit on their shareholders who will be seeing massive intentional losses for the 8th movie in a row. This fits the current counter cultural rebels who have been running Disney behind the scenes for the last 3-4 years making sure nothing that comes out is a hit or at the very least moves products off of shelves.Is South Park right? I feel like they may know a lot more about what is really going on at Disney than anyone else at this point.You can probably just skip this one and just know that Disney is currently trying to blow up the mold of \"Wish Capitalism\" and remove itself from being such a huge part of generations of families. It's like the efforts to take control of oil companies just to run them into the ground at a huge loss but for the benefit of future generations. That is what Wish depicts in fairytale format.Disney over the last decade will at some point be a fascinating case study in American Consumer Culture and Counter Revolutionary Thought, and with this latest move I think Wish is setting itself up as the perfect teaching example.Wish is really brilliant but not in a way that families are going to want to watch - which in itself is the real point of the movie."

In fact all the songs have the weird quality that, while they sound good in themselves, they don't feel like they're from the same movie. For celebrating Disney's 100 years, I wish they'd included at least some traditional animation.But here's why I can't hate this film: I love the subtext of it. It's all about rebellion against stifling authority. And how the combined strength of the many can overcome even the most powerful evils. The defeat of the villain was one of my favorite moments of Disney in years. I just wish the movie lead up to it better.Perhaps it being the 100th anniversary movie put to many demands on it. So many little references to past movies went over my head while watching it. Even the obvious one of each of Asha's friends being a reference to one of the seven dwarfs.

It is a wondrous blend of hand-drawn animation and 3d animation, a la Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. I hope we get many more films animated in this style, as it is very relaxing and nice to look at.If only the story matched the visuals... An overly simple story lacks anything of substance. And yes, I'm taking into account that this is a kids movie. I sympathized with the villain (who did not begin the movie evil) in the beginning of the film, only for him to suddenly turn evil out of no where. The film also suffers from a horrifying over dependence on magic. The songs are very good, but they all sound about the same, which isn't a problem in the movie, but I can't imagine the music in this movie selling many CDs. I do have to give the voice actors some credit though. They didn't do anything award worthy, but they did an excellent job.That being said, while I watched this movie, I enjoyed it. The only reason I went to see it was to take my nephews. Disney has a rich history of making the greatest animated classics of all time.

I wish they had just leaned in and milked this, instead of wasting screen time trying to show us how \"quirky\" the main character is supposed to be, as if it even mattered to the story. The storyline was overall kinda boring.Worldview A point in this movie's favor is that the sorcer overtly practicing witchcraft *is* the bad guy. However, the message of \"hope\" (and they did a whole song about this!) is that we are all (talking animals included) stardust, and that's why we look to the stars and our hearts to guide us. Fake deep new age nonsense.Animation I like that they *tried* to do something unique with the art style. The painted storybook texturing had the potential to be so beautiful, but they really didn't take it far enough, so a lot of the visuals came across as work in progress 3D animation.Music There were some nice musical moments, but overall very meh. I'm tired of the \"let's overexplain by clumsily cramming a bunch of words into a musical number and trying to make it sound like rap\" style that Lin Manuel Miranda likes.

Chris Pine revels in playing a proper Disney villain. No redeeming qualities, constantly sinking lower complimented by a great song that allows him to use an asset that's so rarely utilised.Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn greatest creative swing is the new animation style. It's probably the weakest out of all the recent ones that responded to Spider-verse but its storybook come to life approach still has lots of beauty to it whilst maintaining hints of the previous 3-D animation that dominated for so long.Like the rest of the film, the songs here are good without ever living up to the classics, they don't even really compete with something a lot more recent like Encanto.

As leader of his empire, he collects the dreams and wishes of the people and promises that he can make one of them come true.If Asha makes a wish when she sees a shooting star, this star will make her wish come true. With this star at her side, she tries to show the rest of the people that Magnifico is not an honest leader. His magical powers, which he uses to grant their wishes, are not the correct and only way to make wishes come true.With this film, Disney animation tries to celebrate its hundred years of existence and working on animated films. Despite this reason, unfortunately they have not created a special or unique animated film. This film quickly reminds you of many other films that Disney animation has made over the past hundred years. This film itself has little uniqueness. The film may be fun for younger audiences who are not yet familiar with Disney animated films, but older viewers who would go along with them may not enjoy this film as much.The animation style also tries to come across as if it comes from older animation, to celebrate the centenary. Apart from some creative animation, it unfortunately doesn't feel that special. The film can therefore seem somewhat standard or even boring. Most characters also come across as somewhat standard or even somewhat lifeless. Due to the large group of characters, most of them are given few opportunities to really stand out in the film. Asha's character is the most prominent because she is the main character of the film. Furthermore, Magnifico manages to steal the show as the more corrupt leader, because Chris Pine knows how to provide good voice acting. Alan Tudyk manages to provide some comic moments as a talking goat, but not enough to really make it something special.

Yes, there are some cookie-cutter and generic elements in the film, but it's not entirely a carbon copy of previous Disney films.The antagonist in this movie is revealed rather quickly; even from the very beginning, you know who the bad guy is and have a sense of how it will unfold. But I wouldn't say it's entirely unoriginal, as I've been hearing from many people. True, there are typical Disney songs with castles, kings, queens, and people making wishes upon a star, but I believe people have been overly critical due to recent disappointments with how the company has been managing things.Yes, I agree Disney hasn't been doing so well lately, but I don't think this movie is a bad addition to their tremendously successful catalog. I believe this movie truly holds the essence of emphasizing the importance of having wishes in your life but, more importantly, taking the necessary steps for your dreams to come true.There's been a lot of discussion about Disney's increased diversity in their cast nowadays, but I think it was a good fit for the new film. There were parts of this movie that honestly made me very emotional and pleased with its meaning and message because I've struggled in life to keep my dreams alive and well.Sure, there are talking animals and other Disney-esque elements thrown in, but the movie's meaning is what truly matters, and I think that's what people have been forgetting. I highly recommend people see this movie and not heed all the negativity. It's a good, clean, wholesome, and emotional family film that kids and everyone will enjoy, with meaningful and important messages about being honest with your dreams and never giving up on what you truly wish to become and more! Definitely check it out this holiday season!"

                "content": "People must be desperate to WISH for a good movie from Disney these days. It isn't here. Extremely shallow plot and story and truly cringe songwriting. The writers couldn't even bother to make anything rhyme when shoehorning in their messaging. Nothing to do with the actors, color and what not (don't even start), and all to do with poor writing. It's like Disney put a gun to someone's head and demanded a movie be created based on the \"When you wish upon a star\" Disney theme. If we find out in the news later that that someone likely will be found dead on the floor and that the script was actually AI-generated, I wouldn't be surprised at all. Disney is reaching new lows. Truly.As mentioned by many others, the plot is crazy thin, there is no inner struggle, no mistakes made, no heroes journey, no villain having any sort of depth. On the last note, they actually teased the villain having some sort of back story and justification, but almost as soon as they introduced some of his history and fears, it was swept away reminiscent to a proverbial rug pull straight into shallow villainy. How awesome would it have been if we could be somewhat torn and sympathetic to the idea that some wishes actually can be damaging to others/dangerous, as the movie insinuates for maybe 5 seconds before casting aside? Wow this could have been a decent story, but Disney chose to walk on eggshells. They can't please anyone these days so we must all be triple wrapped in cellophane and styrofoam and forced to watch a \"safe\" movie. They truly lost their touch. It's unfortunate (just in this one instance :D) that my kids really wanted to see this movie so I indulged them. Shame on them! (and me!) lol."

                "content": "\"When You Wish Upon a Star\" is a Walt Disney company theme song, first heard in the 1940 animated classic \"Pinocchio.\" It became the company theme song in the 1950s and has been featured in the studio's motion-picture logo since the early 1980s. Steven Spielberg added fairy dust to the song's mythology when he mentioned playing it over the final moments of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" For Disney, \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" is more than an anthem; it's a symbol of corporate magic and the company's values. Disney's new animated musical, \"Wish,\" is a folk tale about wishes and their connection to stars. The movie is a theme park-ready illustration of Disney's 100th anniversary, as it self-consciously packs 85 years of animated magic into a portable Disney fable. The movie is a blend of pop history and Easter eggs, making it a symbol of the company's focus on itself. The movie's success may be seen as a summation, pastiche, or a Disney fable that launches the next Disney century or is stuck in the last one. The movie's success may be seen as a symbol of Disney's commitment to its own brand and its ability to create a unique and memorable experience for audiences. \"Wish\" is a Disney animated film that is particularly appealing to young children, as it is set in the magical kingdom of Rosas, a tropical island. The residents of the island have a wish, which they give to King Magnifico, a devilishly handsome sorcerer who rules the island and their dreams. When a wish is given to Magnifico, it becomes free and unremembered. The story explores the concept of wishes and their consequences, with the protagonist living without their wish, leaving their soul untroubled. The film is visually pleasing and eminently watchable, with a plot that is both mildly touching and slightly strange. The film is a delightful slice of enchanted product with a slightly strange plot. \"Wish\" is a film that explores the concept of wishes, a deep part of one's identity. The story follows 17-year-old Asha, a spunky idealist who learns that a wish is a symbol of her identity. She applies to become the emperor's apprentice and meets Magnifico, a coiffed goateed smoothie. Asha questions the \"Your wish is mine until I decide to give it back to you\" concept, which reveals Magnifico's true nature. He is a kind leader until his authority is questioned, revealing his inner authoritarian nature. The film is a metaphor for the era of corporate entertainment, where individual dreams are replaced by collective fantasy. The film is a ruthless corporate overlord crossed with Maleficent, and the first Disney villain with serious hair product use. \"Wish\" is a Disney animated film that follows Asha, a young girl who makes a powerful wish that lights up the night sky and makes every citizen of Rosas glow with warmth. The wish is a glowing yellow star named Star, who has real magic. Asha uses her pet goat, Valentino, as her magic wand to take on Magnifico, a demonic figure with extraordinary power. The movie revolves around Asha and her angelic Star vs. Magnifico and his green phosphorescent demonic light, with the fate of the island residents and their wishes hanging in the balance. The film, co-written by Jennifer Lee and executive produced by Allison Moore, is a more muted palette of blue, green, gray, pink, and lavender, creating a pleasing storybook texture. Chris Pine's punchy performance as Magnifico turns him into a volubly self-satisfied narcissist-dictator is a standout performance. The film is a testament to the power of imagination and the power of imagination in bringing stories to life."

                "content": "One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure."

This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil."

                "content": "\"Oppenheimer\" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (\"The Dark Knight trilogy\", \"Inception\", \"Interstellar\", \"Dunkirk\"), based on the biography \"American Prometheus\" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the \"Manhattan Project\", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and \"Fat Man\" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the \"Atomic Age\". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as \"the father of the atomic bomb\", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic \"Oppenheimer\", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's \"Dunkirk\", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, \"Oppenheimer\" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10."

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) \"twist\" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb."

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

                "content": "Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an \"attraction\" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually \"work\" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a \"genius.\" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take \"A Beautiful Mind\" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider \"Schindler's List\" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the \"Father of the A-Bomb\" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is \"star studded.\" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said \"Oh, look who that is,\" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10."

Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon."

We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing."

In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

                "content": "0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film."

I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."

I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

                "content": "At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10."

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia."

It is impossible to say that Oppenheimer is a poorly made product. But, it's definitely nothing more than a good movie. Technically speaking, it is very well produced. The sound work is magnificent, it manages to generate striking scenes, especially the explosion scene. Nolan managed to create a well-made biography, but it is clear the effort he makes to be an artist and in the end he fails. The third act is unbearable, it's stressful and it never seems to end. Oppenheimer's problems scream in your face that they are there, not allowing only the technical qualities to shine. Some scenes are rough precisely because of Nolan's enormous effort to be an artist and not just a good director. The film is good, nothing more than that.

I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)"

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film."

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen). Equally strong is Fennell's screenplay which is hilarious, almost every scene has at least one memorable joke or biting line of dialogue."

I was expecting a sort of hybrid of \"Another Country\" meets \"Brideshead Revisited\" as the story of \"Ollie\" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal \"Felix\" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of \"Felix\" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous \"Farleigh\" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and \"Ollie\" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success."

I don't think it is that deep, whether it was trying to dig into thorny Class stuff (it's a more Personal-Obsessive chronicle than that) when practically everyone is a vampire or not, save, tellingly, for who Oliver actually comes from. Frankly, knowing it was inspired by Talented Mr Ripley going in did no favors by comparison (with a bit of, aside from coincidentally \"You\" season 4, Teorema oddly enough), like at a festival with nothing to go on this might have got to me a little more.However, even with the obvious influences and one particularly glaring story problem - or just with logic involving a cell phone (you know, genius manipulator kid, you can block a phone number or just turn it off) - this is a glorious showcase for Barry Keoghan to (again!) be an intensely, leering, uncomfortable and yet always in his way natural creepy little confusingly-big shlonged weirdo; he and (second time this month post Priscilla an alluring) Elordi have excellent chemistry, and I can't stress enough that, with actors, in particular a scene-stealing Allison Oliver as the f'd-up sister, Fennell has as strong a grasp on her caat and like how far to let Pike and Grant go and when to reel them in (that scene with the checkbook is wonderful).If you want meaty acting, this definitely has that (a new category: Acting Over Substance?), and when it tries to be funny it largely is, and while it doesn't stand out as one of the best of the year it is an entertaining film moment to moment. If you were expecting another round of sociological buckshot in your brain, it doesn't have as much substantive things to say as Promising Young Woman did.Dare I say it now... whatever you got planned for Joker, Barry: bring it."

After a school year, he is invited to join his new friend at his family's enormous castle where we definitely see him in a fish out of water situation.Then things... happen. Oh boy do they happen. This is all I'm going to say but be prepared for a wild ride, and don't be squeamish. I enjoyed this, but it really deserves its R rating. It's very adult and highlights the depths human beings can go, regardless of material wealth.You know I love to find the human experience presented, possibly with a lesson in mental health awareness. Oh God no. Perhaps there is awareness, but there is no lesson.Rosamund Pike does steal the show. Her one liners are absolutely hilarious.Enjoy the ride."

                "content": "My Review - Saltburn My Rating 9/10 In selected Cinemas nowSaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress Emerald Fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance Promising Young Woman which starred her friend Carey Mulligan.Carey Mulligan only plays a cameo role in Saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of Poor Dear Pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.Carey Mulligan in an interview with Margo Robbie a co producer of Saltburn said that the role Emerald Fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. On reading the script Carey Mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear Pamela and Emerald agreed to her request .I'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of Lady Elspeth Catton played in the movie to perfection by Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike.This movie in fact has four Oscar nominees in the cast Richard E. Grant, Barry Keoghan, Carey Mulligan and Rosamund Pike.It's no wonder to me that Emerald Fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, two British Academy Film Awards, one Screen Actors Guild Award, and nominations for three Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards.One reviewer described this movie as a Promising Young Man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.My only regret with this movie is the fact that Emerald Fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of \"peeping in.\" The magnificent cinematography by Linus Sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.I call this movie an Art House black comedy thriller if I had to describe it in a few words I think I would say it's Brideshead Revisited with the style of Peter Greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like The Draughtsman's Contract , Drowning by Numbers and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover .This wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . It may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.Not everyone will share my view but I adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.I couldn't help thinking of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited while watching Saltburn so after seeing the movie I wasn't surprised to read that Emerald Fennell recommended Jacob Elordi the Brisbane born handsome actor read Brideshead Revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .In complete contrast Jacob will be playing Elvis Presley in the forthcoming movie Pricilla based on the early relationship of Pricilla Beaulieu and Elvis .In Saltburn Jacob Elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection Felix Catton the son and heir of Sir James Catton played with delicious detachment by Richard E Grant and Elspeth Catton perfectly cast with the glamorous Rosamund Pike .Rosamund Pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by Sophie Canale who was assistant costume designer on Bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper Oliver Quick also played to perfection by the Academy Award nominated Irish supporting actor Barry Keoghan in The Banshees of Inisherin Barry Keoghan.Barry Keoghan's character Oliver Quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at Oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .His character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his Summer of love into a quest of betrayal.The movie begins with Oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic Felix Catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts Oliver's nerdy dullness . Oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of Felix Catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.Similar to Brideshead Felix invites Oliver to spend the Summer at his family's ancestral home Saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch Elspeth .No spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.As mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled Radcliffe Square in Oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.The stately home that Emerald Fennell chose as Saltburn is Drayton House in Northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again I haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were Archie Madekwe as the young border at Saltburn Farleigh Start who sees through Oliver Quick and becomes an object of jealousy.Also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household Annabelle played by Sadie Soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing Butler played by Paul Rhys are wonderful.I'd love to spend a day in Emerald Fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in Killing Eve ,Promising Young Woman and now Saltburn I find fascinating."

It's well-paced, beautifully presented in terms of production design and cinematography, Barry Keoghan in dazzling in the leading role, and he is well supported by, among others, Jacob Elordi. Archie Madekwe, Alison Oliver and Richard E. Grant. Rosamund Pike, putting her essential chilliness to good use, is surprisingly amusing. But there are few other surprises as we tread through the familiar world of the English upper class and its pampered progeny. Taking a sort of semi-critical stance, writer-director Emerald Fennell summons up the memory of a number of films that examine the British class system. Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Servant, The Go-Between, The Hireling...I even caught a whiff of the very obsure American film Black Flowers for the Bride. I can't work out whether or not Ms Fennell thought she was on to something new. If she did think so, she was clearly mistaken."

There were Multiple Gasps and Audible \"oh god\" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience \"It was all too Wet\" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the \"Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar\" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, \"But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?\" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, \"Ok this is Ok, were building towards something\", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself \"Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels\"😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage \"of Events\" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say \"oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....\"Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it."

Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the \"good\" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down."

In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you. But if you prefer to be allowed to concentrate on the unfolding tale of immorality without the shock and awe, then TTMR is a far better movie."

I hadn't even heard she was doing a follow-up film until suddenly I was watching it as the Secret Screening at Fantastic Fest. Needless to say it blew me away. This was a terrific film experience.I think the thing I love most about Phannell's work is the attention and care she gives to every character. There are no throwaway character's in these movies. Everyone has a purpose and every character is fascinating in their own way.When that's the case it can be hard to single out a particularly good character/performance, and really everyone here was worthy of mention, but in particular I have to bring up Rosamund Pike. She stole every scene she was in. Also Barry Keoghan is fast becoming the best actor working today. He is captivating to watch here.'Saltburn' was such a pleasant surprise. I loved every minute of it and would highly recommend it. Be warned though: this film is not afraid to go to some shocking places. 10/10."

                "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN (2020). She's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. We are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of Barry Keoghan.Oliver Quick (Keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the Class of 2006 at Oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. He becomes transfixed on the BMOC, Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi, fresh off his turn as Elvis in PRISCILLA). Felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. Life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. He's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day Oliver helps him out of a jam. This leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. The first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to Felix inviting Oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... Saltburn.Saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. Felix's eccentric family includes Farleigh (Archie Madekwe, GRAN TURISMO), an adopted \"cousin\" fellow Oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; Venetia (Alison Oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; Poor Dear Pamela (Carey Mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; Sir James Catton (Richard E Grant), the childlike father; and Espeth Catton (Rosamund Pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. It's a motley crew that puts 'The Royal Tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.As the summer progresses, we see Oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. His non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. As viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with Oliver, yet director Fennell and Keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. Those hopes are dashed once we see Keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and Fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.The third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with Fennell and Oscar winning cinematographer Linus Sandgren (LA LA LAND) creating an Old World style within a contemporary world. The film is perfectly cast with Elordi quite magnetic as Felix, the not-so-obscure object of Oliver's desire. Madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting Farleigh, and Grant and Pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. Alison Oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while Keoghan nails the creepy Oliver (in line with his roles in THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER, and THE BATMAN. He has become the go-to psychopath. He even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY (1999) as its most obvious comparison. Ms. Fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.Opening in theaters on November 22, 2023."

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching."

                "content": "Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend."

Murdering your way to the top of an aristocratic family in the way that Emerald Fennell has constructed it, is very twenty-first century because of the ending but it does not make snese. And that is the problem for me. The reviewing of previous events from a different perspective implies a cynicism and motive that does not fit the main character. So when it is presented, astute members of the audience are not going to view it as a twist but are more likely to think \"Hang on a minute, what about when....???\" So whose fault is that? Scriptwriter and director are the immediate culprits and here they are the one and only Emerald Fennell. Her Oscar for the \"Promising Young Woman\" may have been justified. I don't think she's going to get anything for this one unless the \"Razzies\" are stuck for choice.Just a note about Barry Keoghan and his performance . I wish I was a fly on the wall when his agent convinced him to a) be stark-naked and pretend to \"screw\" through the freshly-dug grave of a main character to highlight his obssession with said character and b) pretend to lick the porcelain floor of the bath where that obssession has just masturbated, (\"Saw\" franchise please take note, if you want to push the boundaries of revulsion, check if Fennell is doing anything).

It then rushes through the 3rd act where the body count stacks up so quickly it doesn't have time to be impactful. The grave scene was utterly ridiculous, I felt embarrassed for everyone involved in the making of that scene, but yeah somehow it got made.Respect to the Music Supervisor though, some great choices including Bloc Party & Tomcraft.

All of the production designs are gorgeous throughout, especially with the costumes and structures as it was very colorful with the 1:33:1 aspect ratio feeling purposeful. All of the performances are pretty great, especially Barry Keoghan as Keoghan continues to impress me with his performing abilities since Dunkirk. Alongside with the rest of the cast members as Rosamund Pike, Jacob Elordi, Richard E. Grant and so forth are really good as well and their performances were strong as well. The soundtrack is also really catchy.On the narrative, I did find the narrative's concept to be interesting as the concept explores interesting themes of wealth, sexuality, and class about the characters and settings that does get pretty unhinged and insane. Unfortunately, despite liking some of the writing, the narrative does get uneven since some of the writing aspects were predictable and certain moments feeling way too similar to \"Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Talented Mr. Ripley or The Servant\". Especially the third act and twist which while I am not sure it was intentional, the third act pretty much falls apart and I found the twist to not be really shocking and it being predictable. For the characters, while I understand the purposes for the characters' personalities and decisions, I found the characters to be a mix of some interesting and uninteresting as the uninteresting ones felt annoying. Including the editing as the editing is surprisingly, pretty rough.The dialogue is solid with some a bit silly and the color presentation is good. There are uses of dark humor, satire and quite a lot of horny moments throughout and while some of the satire and humor worked, not all worked as some of the dark humor, satire and horniest comes off a bit full of itself.I wanted to really love this movie because the style, writing and genre is something I like. I really love the concept, direction, camerawork, and performances but I was left wanting more than since the movie feels slightly sloppy and kind of full of itself. Overall, ambitious and had a strong first act but I didn't love it as I wanted too. This might end up becoming a possible cult movie someday. I probably would check this one out again someday to see if my perspective has changed later on.For now. It's a 6/10."

More or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, British version of The Talented Mr Ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.Having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.Our protagonist Oliver (Barry Keoghan) is a scholarship boy at Oxford. Initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich Felix (Jacob Elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. There he is introduced to the bizarre world of the British aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.Having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. We are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between Oliver and Felix's sister Venetia (Alison Oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.As a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.There are strong performances throughout the film - Rosamund Pike, as Felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. Jacob Elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a British aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. Richard E. Grant, as Felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.And there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. Pamela (Carey Mulligan) is a guest at Saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. Farleigh (Archie Madekwe) is Oliver's rival for Felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. This is particularly disappointing as Archie Madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.The final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. At 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and I confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

In only her second film, the popular writer-director has already soared past expectations, delivering a film which not only far surpasses the success of her debut Promising Young Woman (which was excellent), but which succeeds so well in its ambitions that it might even belong in the conversation for genre classic. It certainly lands quite high among my personal favorites for films of its kind.In my opinion, Saltburn is a masterpiece. A purely singular, cinematic tour-de-force, with an abundance of style, all put to use in service of a story that is both attractive and engrossing, while never ceasing to be entertaining. It's the kind of film that sears itself in your memory with it's brazenness-to say nothing of the level of prurience that permeates some of the more salacious/depraved bits. I know that sounds like it could be a negative, but believe me, it definitely works in this film's favor; keeping the tone both erotically charged as well as deeply unsettling. In fact, the whole film is astoundingly well-balanced, maintaining a sly confidence in itself which makes it all the more entrancing despite (because of?) it taking things to such extremes. Occasionally you might feel like recoiling, but still you'll be unable to look away.Since the film only released wide several weeks ago, I'll refrain from saying much about plot specifics in this review (nothing beyond superficial comparison anyway), as I'd hate to spoil anyone from having the same incredible experience I had going in blind. This is an opportunity that hopefully most people will be afforded, owing to the stellar marketing for the film which somehow managed to build intrigue without revealing hardly anything about the story (take note studio heads, this is how it should be done!). It's an especially blessed achievement in this case, since this is a film with a fiendishly original script, and it'd be a shame to miss out on any of its myriad surprises.Additionally, with Saltburn, Emerald Fennell has not only gifted us fans of crime/mystery novels with a modern genre masterpiece, she has also given us the best Ripley movie without Tom Ripley. Indeed, the film evokes a superlative, verging on definitive, homage to the famous amoral hedonist with a knack for escaping consequences, and I would honestly be shocked to find out Fennell wasn't a Highsmith fan. At times this script feels almost like a re-imagining of The Talented Mr. Ripley for the millennial generation; albeit one cleverly tailored to the sensibilities and fluidity of the Euphoria crowd. The use of hyper-stylized cinematography, as well as the decidedly \"in vogue\" choice of music, also evoke the style of that series to a degree. That said, Jacob Elordi playing against type as the aristocrat Felix Catton (ostensibly just a rich/spoiled playboy, but whose surprisingly sensitive side may reveal him to be an actual decent guy) subverts those expectations in the best way.Whatever the reality behind her inspiration, this film is in no way a mere imitation of another work. Instead, Fennell more than proves her mettle as a writer/director capable of realizing an original vision to powerful effect. Frankly, she couldn't seem more at home in the genre, and despite a concept that on the surface may appear to be aiming at mere homage, Fennell spares no time proving that notion false; taking a deceptively original approach to a tried and true theme, and running with it to intoxicating effect.Saltburn is an utterly enthralling mystery, with an impressively sustained blend of familiarity and unpredictability. The script is brimming with witty dialogue, wickedly dark humor, compelling social commentary on class division, and no shortage of clever twists. All in all, this makes for a fiercely captivating affair from start to finish. So much so, in fact, that when the many disparate threads finally start to come together in the final act, the result is harrowing and nothing short of extraordinary!This is filmmaking of the highest order from someone who is quickly becoming one of the most interesting artists working today. If it wasn't such a crowded year I would say Fennell was a shoe-in for another best original screenplay nom. Although then again, when considering the uncomfortable nature of certain moments in the film, it may be a stretch to think the academy is ready to vote for something this far out. I hope they're not all too close-minded to recognize Fennell's talent though, and this ends up getting at least some (well-deserved) awards attention. In any case, if she's able to keep up the momentum then her work will soon be impossible to ignore, no matter how dark/insane she decides to go with her next project. Personally, I'd love to see her re-team with Keoghan/Mulligan and try her hand at a full-on horror flick!Anyways, beyond the film's critical reception, what will perhaps be most interesting will be seeing the overall response it receives from general audiences. I'd imagine they won't be expecting just how shocking some aspects of the story are, and all those forming their expectations based on her first film (like I did) are likely to be caught off guard by a handful of these scenes (if not outright turned off). The film never felt in any way exploitative or pretentious to me though. On the contrary, I felt like the balance and tone that it struck were basically flawless. Even if a small number of viewers do find it too offensive, that will probably just add to the allure of the film. Ultimately, the purity of conviction shown by the creative team in taking things as far as they did clearly panned out well.Suffice it to say, I've never seen anything quite like this film, and I was completely blown away. In fact, for me, it rather handily beats out Oppenheimer, Beau is Afraid, and Killers of the Flower Moon as the best of the year, and I'd go so far as to call it a film destined to be discussed, analyzed, argued over, and admired by cinephiles of every kind for many years to come.Finally, I'd be remiss not to mention the film's true Oscar potential, and that's Barry Keoghan. His raw performance as the socially awkward, yet smart and deeply enigmatic loner Oliver Quick is so brilliantly nuanced, mysterious, and disturbing that I can all but guarantee it will \"make your blood run cold.\" Barry is absolutely the underdog to look out for come award season, and this film proves, decisively, that he was the perfect choice to take up the mantle of the Joker.Rating: 10/10.....Edited to add - I can't believe I forgot to praise the film's amazing use of MGMT's \"Time to Pretend\" in one of its early montages! I've been waiting forever for someone to re-tap the potential of the song, and its use here might be the best of any song since Pixies' \"Where is my Mind?\" at the end of Fight Club."

But its \"shocking\" moments are so odd that ruin what could have otherwise been a good story. I'm sure some of these 10 out 10 ratings will call on the message of mental illness as thought provoking or other flowery symbolism that is unlike the typical hollywood movie. But I would avoid this if you are an average filmgoer. Especially those that just wants to see a movie that is entertaining and unique without leaving you feel like you just watched some screen writers most dismayed plot just to be edgy.There were a couple truly disgusting scenes of perversion that added no value to the story. Not to mention the holes in the plot. Holes like why would he go through the lengths that he took to infiltrate and take down the family members one by one? Oh, because he loved Felix so much....right. We find out that he set out to befriend Felix from the very start, but why? This would have made more sense if there was an actual motive other than he was unbalanced and just wanted to be loved. Save your time and money."

Perhaps is to be aware of poor social climbers who exhibit intelligence. I know WAY too many people like that. Which could be the message in itself. The idea of being popular runs a little too dark when a chance meeting between Felix (a rich Gatsby-esque character played by Jacob Elordi) and Oliver (a socially awkward, possibly autistic, bright literary genius) at Oxford.There are a few things that will rub you the wrong way. Yes, it's suppose to be a dark comedy. I think Rosamund Pike, who plays Felix's mother is the only one who understands that the key to dark comedy is to be a bit over the top. Richard E. Grant plays the Dad who, unfortunately doesn't get the big eyed meltdown until the end. The other things you will either love or hate.... There is no reason for ANYONE to like Oliver. Ever. Barry Keoghan plays him great, but it isn't like he flips a switch and becomes charismatic. In fact, he just becomes a weirdo saying charismatic things. Perhaps that's the intention. The family is so devoid of emotion that any genuine sign of it gains acceptance. Again, I never felt that.There is absolutely NO reason for Oliver to know that Felix would be so generous as to ingratiate him into his family by a flat tire ruse. The conceit of this entire film relies on the idea that Oliver is a grifter preying on this family and that someone would be kind enough to take him in. He sees what he wants, then has the shameless nature of approaching each one to gain favor. Honestly, one of the worse flip of the switch is when Oliver observes the sister of the household and seduces her (after a few words--saying she's a nympho doesn't make it so).Any way, Rosamund Pike is the only good thing about this flick. Jacob Elordi is also really good at embodying the rich snob with a heart. The rest is a bit mediocre. If you've seen these types of identity starved sociopath movies, you'll know what you're watching."

Barry Keoghan gave not only his best but a career defining performance that will be remembered for years to come. The final scene of him will be seared in my brain for the foreseeable future (might even be forever). I adore Emerald Fennell's signature style, and after her directorial debut \"Promising Young Woman\" in 2020, I was eager to see what she comes up with next. \"Saltburn\" absolutely delivered the thrills, laughs, weirdness, sexiness, eeriness, and stylish personality that the first film encompasses but double downs on it tenfold. It is a very British psychological thriller with plenty of charm, youthful energy, and originality. The early 2000s aesthetic is lush and on point. I truly believe that this film utilizes the so-called 'eat the rich' narrative perfectly, and is easily the best film of that genre. The film is kind of a cross between Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" and Mike White's \"The White Lotus\". I need the film's soundtrack like yesterday. I have nothing but undying respect, gratitude, and praise for filmmaker Emerald Fennell. \"Saltburn\" is one of the best films of the year. Bravo to all involved, especially Emerald Fennell and Barry Keoghan.*At one point in the movie, Felix (Jacob Elordi) says what everyone is thinking: \"I'm so effing hot.\" If Jacob Elordi showed even the slightest interest in me, I too would be driven mad with love.Final verdict: 10/10."

The arrival of new psychologist \"Rebecca\" (Anne Hathaway) injects a little life into her dull routine. This assertive sophisticate takes an interest in \"Eileen\", they go for a drink - there's even some flirting - before \"Rebecca\" shares a secret with her new friend that involves a young man in prison accused of the brutal murder of his father, and of just what his mother might know of the crime and it's causes. The first hour is quite intriguing but that sense of anticipation is let down by a last half hour that is really quite undercooked and the denouement, well that is just incomplete - on just about every level. The acting and writing is fine - nothing more, but I left the screening thinking that something was missing. What exactly was the point here? It's a good looking film - effort has certainly gone into the aesthetic but I'm not sure I'm really any the wiser."

Because for most of the first 2/3rds I just couldn't figure out where the film was going. Sometimes for better but sometimes it meant that a lot of those portions dragged considerably. The 3rd act takes a pretty drastic change that I found pretty intriguing but I don't think had enough set up to fully justify. It made me wish that the script focused on a different perspective than it did in retrospect. The ending is also pretty abrupt and left me with more questions than answers. Thomasin Mackenzie and Anne Hathaway are great though and every scene that they share are when the film was at it's most captivating. It's also very well shot with a really good 60's like aesthetic. Eileen as is was a pretty intriguing ride but it's hard not to think that there's better version of this story existed in the script somewhere."

This movie strides through the genres: from lesbian romance akin to Carol to Classic Noir to Horror, even a touch of Hitchcock with a soupcon of Black Comedy. Massachusetts, early 1960s Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) is a young secretary in a juvenile prison, she's lonely, dreams of love with one of the young guards, is fascinated by an inmate Lee Polk who killed his father, the Polk family are central to the unfolding of the narrative. Eileen looks after her alcoholic ex-cop father, he's verbally abusive but some of this might be designed to drive hr away to her away, to find a life of her own. A new prison Psychologist, Rebecca (Anne Hathaway) arrives and sweeps Eileen off her feet, takes her drinking and dancing, then involves her on a strange and dangerous situation. There is a plot twist at this point that cannot be revealed here without giving too much of the storey line away. The Classic Noir tinged with Horror takes over at this point, Eileen reveals her own hidden depths of depravity. Matching or even outclassing Rebecca. Her fantasy life has always been quite violent and some of this may have have bled through to influence her real life actions. Great performances from McKenzie. Hathaway and Marin Ireland as Rita Polk, Lee's mother. Directed by William Oldroyd with a screenplay by by Ottessa Moshfegh and Luke Goebel. 8/10."

We get no Act 3 and no resolution to what went on in the whole film. Every single plot point was left open with too much room left to interpretation. I honestly got hooked onto these characters and invested in their lives and stories and from Act 1 to Act 2 I felt like the film had an average score of a 7 that turned into an 8, but when everything ended so suddenly that score in my head dropped to where it is now. This film really should have had another hour to explore the consequences of the character's actions whether they were allowed to lead their same lives or not.

                "content": "At first, I'd want to say the film Eileen 'Carol by way of Jim Thompson,' and all this while being based on a whole other book (unread by me). But that makes it sound both more emotionally restrained and/or romantic and even more unpleasant than this is or could even pretend to be. And there is a nasty streak running through this that means you can't much \"like\" anyone or \"relate\" and that is, in its way in 2023 cinema, refreshing. Needless to say, it's my kind of thoroughly engrossing, perverse, precisely character-based and subjectively presented study Neo-Noir, where circumstance and chance meets the fatalism of a child of a cop, and yet...I didn't think it was tonally all over the place as I've seen a few of the reactions, as it is all of a piece as we are seeing things from this young woman's jaundiced and outsider-y perspective. On that level, for as unpleasant as things get for Eileen (and as unpleasant as she makes things eventually), it is all about a woman - a human being, but especially as a woman - who has so little prospects or hope for much in the way of change for herself, and the one new beacon of light is quite up front about what she gets out of people (and that is... pretty one sided!)And if you need a connecting thread, going back to this as a Feminist story (or an anti-Feminist one if that is your reading), one could say Eileen is about a woman realizing who she is, what is her agency (and the full dearth of it), why she needs to break free, and this despite everything in her life being crap. As is the case with countless Film Noirs and Femme Fatales, sometimes it takes that one New Wild Card Connection (ie Stanwyck in Double Indemnity) to shake things up and change things; Rebecca hearkens back to so many of the cunning and sultry blond women of yore, only this time the \"Average Joe\" archetype is a mousy young lady who is at a muddy crossroads with a Very Bad Dad (though he's not the only one, as it turns out eventually.... mild spoiler).The film is brown and gray and smokey-looking, locations highlighting snow snd Christmas time can still look decrepid, but you dont feel totally despairing watching even as Eileen the character may be at points (that shot of her in the bathtub, my goodness). Eileen the film is, like Carol, beautifully shot despite/because it has such a moribund and brooding color palette and vibe. And McKenzie and a career-best Hathaway have electric chemistry (which, as it turns out, is all part of the Hathaway-Rebecca character's entire persona to act like she has this chemistry with anyone as a perpetual user), while Shea Wigham and Marin Ireland appear in bursts in this like these little tornados that pick you up and thrash you around with what they unleash on the audience.The ending is... hmm. Gotta sleep a little more of that one. Or... maybe not. Maybe that does make sense on a story level, and I wanted one more McKenzie and Hathaway scene (McKenzie by the way gets a much more unnerving and difficult person to portray, totally f-ed up and horny and confused and full of potential for violence, and it's nice to see her with someone meaty after Last Night in Soho didn't give her as much). But Eileen hits the spot if you're hankering for an (eventually) suspenseful story of moral decay and the things that make life worth living - like watching the partner you have a crush on punching a man for coming on so strong and then going back to dance without a care in the world."

It started out alright but ended really weird. Thomasin plays a secretary at a juvenile detention center in 1960's Boston. She leads a boring life and lives with her father, Shea. Shea is a retired cop and sits around the house a lot, just drinking and swinging his service revolver around in the air-I guess to remind everyone that he used to be a cop. Jefferson plays the cop that keeps answering the call when Shea gets his gun out. Anne plays the new psychiatrist at the center and becomes friends with Thomasin. Thomasin has a lot of fantasies and day dreams-some sexual, some murderous-and starts to think that Anne may have some feelings towards her.

Most movies have at least some redeeming value, and it's almost an indictment of my own flick-picking skills to give one the bare minimum. But that's where I find myself with Eileen--a mess of a film without a single coherent character or theme.For a very basic overview, Eileen tells the story of the titular character (Thomasin McKenzie), a 20-something secretary at a boys prison in 1960s New England. She hates her job, has no romantic potentials, and is also basically a care nurse for a drunkard ex-cop father (Shea Whigham). But when the prison hires new psychologist Rebecca (Anne Hathaway), Eileen finds a sort of kindred spirit or role model to give her life a little glimmer of hope--until a scenario unfolds that threatens to destroy both of them.There's no way that a film starring Hathaway, McKenzie, and even Whigham should be this devoid of entertainment or thematic relevance--yet here we are. Eileen is the epitome of \"throwing stuff at the wall and see what sticks\" filmmaking, and in this case it all slides to the floor. I did not feel compelled by a single plot element--even the curveball thrown near the film's end--and I had not an ounce of care for any single character, as their creation and unfolding were so oblique and all over the place. Not a single morsel to sink my teeth into.After listening to an interview with the writers/director and hearing them essentially say that the film can mean \"whatever you make of it\", and implying that parts may be closer to fantasy than reality, it pretty much sealed the deal for me. Perhaps if you enjoy providing every scrap of plot sensibility and character motivation yourself you'll like this far more than I, but it I am not a fan of such movie-making unless it is exquisite--and Eileen is a far cry from that."

                "content": "\"Eileen\" focuses on the titular lead character (Thomasin McKenzie), a young woman in 1960s Massachusetts. Her life is less than ideal: she is sexually repressed, professionally stifled in her job as an administrative worker in a young men's prison, and has to deal with her widowed and neurotic alcoholic father (Shea Whigham) at home. Eileen's downbeat existence is upheaved, however, by the arrival of Rebecca (Anne Hathaway), a glamorous and charismatic psychiatrist who is hired at the prison. The two women's encounters with one another eventually lead down a dark path.Based on the novel of the same name by Ottessa Moshfegh (who co-wrote the screenplay), \"Eileen\" is immediately striking simply on a visual level, as every frame of it is steeped in atmosphere. The film is bathed in a wave of rusty sepias and cool blues, the only real color popping up in the form of Christmas lights or Thomasin Mackenzie's bright red lipstick. The time period and place in which it is set (1960s New England) is also demonstrated impeccably. This works greatly to the film's advantage, given that its narrative arc is quite sparsely drawn (and I don't mean that as a demerit)--simply that the story is lean and succinct.The first two acts largely work to establish Eileen's loneliness and depressing interpersonal dynamics with her father, with Hathaway's character jutting in and unknowingly shaking up Eileen's humdrum routine. It is at times difficult to discern where the story is exactly going; there are hints of a budding lesbian love affair, though the character perspectives and their foggy motives more or less put the brakes on this avenue (at least for one of them). There is a dark twist in the last act that feels somewhat arbitrary, though it functions in terms of driving the timid Eileen to take drastic actions for once in her life (for better or for worse). If nothing else, the climax of the film is disturbing.While I feel that the film comes across as slightly irresolute in terms of character motives and their relationship to the events that transpire in the climax, what makes it all ultimately work is the well-written dialogue paired with McKenzie and Hathaway's performances. McKenzie excels in her portrayal of the emotionally downtrodden protagonist, while Hathaway goes full-throttle (bordering on camp) as the Harvard-educated, freewheeling Rebecca, a woman with her own unnamed demons. Shea Whigham also gives a memorable performance as Eileen's alcoholic ex-cop father.While I think the screenplay leaves behind a few loose ends in the wake of arbitrary events and decisions, I suppose it is also worth noting that these loose ends, arbitrary events, and decisions are also sometimes demonstrative of life itself. The film effectively depicts just how the chemistry between two humans can quickly spiral into a grim and dangerous place, with neither party foreseeing it. The fact that it is visually stunning and robustly acted make it worth viewing. 8/10."

Very thoughtful attention to period detail (mid-60s, small-town Massachusetts), outstanding mood and mostly careful pacing contribute to the success of the film, but it is the never-less-than-gripping performance of Thomasin McKenzie (LEAVE NO TRACE) and the slightly unhinged work from Anne Hathaway that make this a film well worth the viewer's time.Eileen (McKenzie) is a young lady who returns home to her small town from college when her mother falls ill. As the movie begins, her mother had died and her father, the former police chief of the town, hangs around the house all day, drinking gin and does little other than berate his daughter and occasionally brandish a gun in the neighborhood, yelling at kids. Eileen has a secretarial job at the local boys prison, and spends much of her day gazing at the young men around her (both inmates and staff) and indulging in various fantasies, some involving sex and others involving violence. She is ostensibly her father's care-taker, but other than buying him booze, she doesn't do anything to keep house or to encourage her dad or herself to move forward. She is stuck. Other than her fantasies, it's hard to see that she has an ambition, drive or future.Enter the new prison psychologist, Rebecca (Hathaway), a Harvard grad full of modern ideas. She's been dropped right into a boys and men's club of an institution, where it's clear her new ideas and unconventional approach to work and life will likely just run her into a brick wall of resistance. If the prison is a square hole, she is certainly a round peg. But she's also the electricity that ignites Eileen. Her passions, her interests, her very appearance are transformed when Rebecca shows an interest in her.Eileen is clearly vulnerable to such an outside influence, and it's pretty clear that Rebecca is exploiting this...somehow. We're never quite sure where this relationship might be going, emotionally or physically. But when it reaches a turning point, it's a crazy ride for the viewers. The surprise of the film is delivered in such a matter-of-fact way that we are both shocked and nod our heads in acknowledgment. We didn't see it coming but it makes perfect sense, given what we've seen of these characters.No further plot points will be revealed, but suffice it to say that the final 15 - 20 minutes or so of this film are filled with incredible tension and leave your mind reeling with all the possibilities and potential consequences. Director William Oldroyd (his second film after the even more compelling LADY MACBETH) juggles what is really a lurid genre piece into a gripping character study. We watch Eileen's growth and actions with grim fascination. McKenzie is just terrific in this film and Hathaway chews the scenery to just the right degree. And Marin Ireland makes a great impression in a small but pivotal role.It's not a perfect film. Shea Wigham is fine as Eileen's father, but the role is very one-dimensional. We aren't given a chance to see that man that once was. The other very minor characters in the film are also one-dimensional too. And certainly, even at 96 minutes, one feels the film slackening its pace once or twice. I'm okay with a slow burn, but there are a few minutes of the film where nothing really seems to happen. I'd guess it could have ultimately come in at 91 minutes and not missed a beat. But these are pretty minor quibbles. It was a lot of fun, in the end."

The film is expertly executed in every phase of the filmmakers art, I don't think that can be disputed but for those that what all the loose ends tied up or a conclusive ending, they will find the film unsatisfying. I can tell you this; I would be pleased if only half the movies I go to see were as well done as 'Eileen' and I think the movie will stay with you and make you think. It was only then, after I had seen it and digested it that I fully appreciated the full quality of the film."

As they go to the bar and Eileen hopes it will be okay and it goes well. With the music and even the dancing of the two girls it is so well done that I almost had tears in my eyes. In the next third it was the boy in the prison who had killed his father and we see his mother called in by the older woman Anne Hathaway, she refuses to speak at the meeting. The third part of the film is incredible like a noir, nasty and wonderful. At the very end there is something else that is strange but happy, maybe. Moving and difficult, but a very good film."

She does so Little(For the Most Part) in her Emoting and she's so Dialed Down(within this Film Performance), and Yet is So Effective. On top of that \"You have a Plain Face\" as Rebecca puts it. And Honestly, in her Case Specifically, that Plainness works in her Favour in multiple Aspects. Another thing also, she totally sells that she was in Love with Rebecca. 😍💛 Anne Hathaway, what more can I say. Just so Skilled in Acting Ability and Line Delivery. She plays this Shady, Sure of Herself, Sexy character named Rebecca, who Eileen is in Love With.💚 Marin Ireland, Super Strong Performance in my Opinion, she's not In the film for long but that segment near the end that she gets was Shocking as Hell and the Stakes were also Strong because of This.🍻 Shea Whigham, he plays the Drunk Dad, and I really like the scenes with his character and Eileen just talking. Good acting and Strong Performance from him.2. 🎵 The Score was really good and effective in multiple Scenes.3a. 📜💬 The Screenplay, I loved some of the moments of \"outta nowhere\" gunshots happening to either themselves or other people, because of the Auditorium Being so loud, anytime it was a long prolonged quiet scene, I was just waiting on edge 😆, but it only happens 3 times. Also, all of the Dialogue was Strong, many scenes are just people talking but it was delivered well and was interesting, when you have scenes that are just people talking yet keep people engaged (me anyway), you've won half the battle.3b. 📈The Plotline, I won't give away the Plotline but let's just say, things take a turn for the worst.4. 🎥 The Cinematography and Edits were Solid.And here's my 1 Major Gripe with the Film -1. 😔 Why that Very ending? Look, I haven't read the Book but even if the book ends like that, you CANNOT end the film like that. They needed to rewrite just that Very Ending, everything up until Eileen hitches a Ride Works. Just go back a bit and do something with that \"situation\" that Eileen and Rebecca were in.When the film ended, I could feel that the audience were bewildered when it ended, and everyone just got up slowly like \"that's it?\" 🤷Overall, a Great watch, a Slow Build with Outstanding Performances but that Very ending just brings the film down so much (for me)."

Yeah I have no idea either) and is apparently based on a 2015 book of the same name which I haven't read as to be honest I only saw a trailer for the film about a week ago. Set in 1960s Massachusetts the story is set around the titular (any excuse to use that word) character played by Thomasin McKenzie. Eileen works at an all boys prison as is a bit set in the ways of her everyday routine. She goes to work and then she comes home only to have to continue working basically as a carere for her alcholic dad played by Shea Whigham (no relationship to the police officer in the Simpsons although he was good in Boardwalk Empire). Eileen's life is changed when one day when the prison brings in a new physiologist called Rebecca played by Anne Hathaway who let's just say doesn't play by the rules.As I mentioned earlier I only saw a trailer for this film about a week a go otherwise I wouldn't have known about it (good job marketing). The trailer was very vague and for this type of film it needed to be and so what it was mainly the cast that had me intrigued about this one. Thomasin McKenzie you might remember was the lead in Edgar Wrights Last Night in Soho, a film in which she shown in for me. I was surprised to not have seen her in more things since then but I'm happy to say she's back on fine form here. She's playing a character that needed to be played with subtly. A character that is learning about herself and developing slowly as the film moves on and Thomasin does a great job of getting those emotions across. She even outshone Anne Hathaway for me which is some feat considering she puts in a solid performance in this film too.As for the story itself, it's very much a slow burn focused around self discovery and watching a young woman start to find herself in the world. It's really not for everyone and I did feel that despite its runtime being just shy of 100 minuets it didn't always use that time as well as it could have. I particularly found the ending to be a bit disappointing especially after a film that up until that point does a good job of keeping the tension and keeping the audience guessing as to where the film is going next. If you enjoy good acting and don't mind a slow burn thriller then this one's for you but I do feel this one's going to have quite a niche target audience and may struggle at the box office."

By the end of the film something so big has come along that you're not thinking about what Rebecca's secrets are any more as the situation has turned to something much more urgent.The shock of the twist was certainly out of left field and gives the viewer a very effective, if unpalatable, jolt; however after the credits roll you feel tricked that the film gets you intrigued about Rebecca and then doesn't give any answers about her aside from the fact she's clearly able to get herself into quite a (justified imo) pickle.Unfortunately the 3rd act feels rushed... Rebecca disappears, which would be fine if the film gave this disappearance and its effect on Eileen any time to breathe. Instead Eileen is surprisingly chill about the whole situation, she instantly comes up with another plan (was it meant to look like carbon monoxide suicide? When she's clearly been shot in the shoulder? The car will be traced directly back to her surely)I was left bemused about what she was happy about in the truck at the end, after everything she's just been through there really is nothing to be smiling about. I guess they wanted it to feel like a happy ending even though it really wasn't?I'm giving this 6 purely because the performances were brilliant which elevate it from being a 5."

Eileen lives with her dad, a retired cop who is an alcoholic and emotionally abusive of Eileen. Then just in time before Christmas, the corrections facility introduces the new resident psychologist, a splashy dame from Harvard named Rebecca... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the screen adaptation of the novel of the same name, which I have not read and hence I cannot comment how closely the movie stick to the book. The best aspects of the film are the two leading performances: Thomasin McKenzie (as Eileen) and Anne Hathaway (as Rebecca) are solid, period. Alas, it's not their faut that the script leaves them shorthanded for a good part on the movie. Indeed the Big Reveal doesn't come until just over an hour into the movie, and hence the \"crime drama\" part gets only the last half hour. Id this a \"bad\" movie? It is not. But neither is it great or a \"near classic\" as another reviewer here puts it. For that the movie lacks the necessary punch.\"Eileen\" is currently playing in US theaters. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (only 3 people including myself). Even though \"Eileen\" is currently rated 85% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, I can't see this playing much longer in the theater. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you are in the mood for an ok, but just ok, psychological crime drama, check it out and draw your own conclusion."

I really love films that make go, \"Wow! I can't believe that happened.\" And I really thought the music added a lot to the picture as well. There were no Lenny Bernstein compositions, but the songs were just as integral to the movie.If you like film Noir, if your like strangeness, and unusual characters, give Eileen a watch.

I thought the actual direction and acting were very good throughout the film (not Oscar worthy but good), but i found the actual screenplay to not go as deep as it needed to, nor did it try too hard with the substance when it comes in context to the shapement of Black voices in a Caucasian-driven hollywood.

                "content": "Cord Jefferson's American Fiction is a satire about an African American novelist who criticizes the industry that restricts Black storytelling to trauma and poverty narratives. The film is a response to the rise of social movements like #BlackLivesMatters and #OscarsSoWhite, which often focus on traumatic violence and provide white liberals with an outlet to empathize with suffering. However, making a movie as a response to industry limitations can limit the movie's intention. Cord Jefferson, a TV writer on Succession and Master of None, delivers a superb feature debut, filled with snappy banter and gags, with a masterful ensemble cast including Jeffrey Wright, Sterling K Brown, and Tracee Ellis Ross. Jefferson adapts Percival Everett's 2001 novel Erasure into a thorny existential character drama about a writer who feels unseen but never makes himself vulnerable enough for people to truly see him. Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison is the professor who pulls a Bamboozled by cynically writing a novel filled with pandering cliches and tropes about Black struggle that salivating white gatekeepers line up to make it a sensational hit. The success does little to alter Monk's disgruntled and bewildered state.Jefferson's film is wisely critical of Monk and society the author is railing against. There is a strain of self-hate in the character, who is regularly ridiculed for his taste for white wine and white women. Monk copes with micro-aggressions in the office and on the street while insisting in the most blatant self-delusional ways that he doesn't believe in race. When Monk sees a best-selling novel called We's Lives in Da Ghetto celebrated by the literary establishment for its Precious-like storytelling, he attends a panel where the author Sintara Golden, played generously by Issa Rae, is code-switching to entertain her mostly white audience. On a lark, Monk writes his own hood novel under a pseudonym, which would snuggly fit into the 50 Cent movie Get Rich or Die Tryin'. The movie almost gets away from Jefferson during outrageously funny moments, as actors like Adam Brody play up the industry's ignorance and craven exploitation of marginalized voices to the point of parody. The festival audience was howling, likely because few feel implicated in such interactions. \"American Fiction\" is a satire directed by Cord Jefferson, based on Percival Everett's novel, Erasure. The film explores the dilemma of making entertainment that criticizes it, as it can easily fall prey to its own pitfalls. The film is grounded by the family melodrama and warm interactions between Monk and his siblings, allowing the Black characters to escape the world's perception of them. The film follows Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison, a struggling writer who becomes fed up with \"lesser\" books that pander to white people through stereotypical hood narratives. Monk decides to write a fake book, initially titled \"My Pafology\" and later re-titled the F word,\" which is so stereotyped that it mirrors the corrupt tastes of the white literary establishment. Despite expecting the novel to fail spectacularly, it becomes a raging success, leading to a major book deal and a movie option."

I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of \"The Photograph (2020),\" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie."

The script is sprightly, with interweaving narratives and metanarratives, with the central character writing a story within a story, which soon develops into a film within a film. That sounds as though it might be pretentiously arty, but it isn't at all. It's often very funny. But because there is a central story of great poignancy, led tenderly by Leslie Uggams, as the protagonist's mother, and Myra. Lucretia Taylor as her longtime help and friend, the movie as a whole is less daunting, and therefore perhaps less challanging, then a piece by, say, Charlie Kauffman, who might have been much more astringent with the same material. So, less austere than it might have been, but intelligent all the same, compassionate and entertaining. The cast is excellent throughout. Jeffery Wright, who is a wonderful actor, really ought to get an Oscar nomination for his work in the central role, but the Academy never recognises fine acting in anything other than Grand movies. This is simply a good movie."

Jeffrey Wright, who's normally seen as an enjoyable supporting actor, takes the helm of this film and leads it convincingly. His character's repeated desire to be seen and validated is opposite from the crafty, suspenseful roles that I'm used to seeing from Wright, which became more impressive as the character's vulnerabilities started to flesh out. The film asks an important question that seems to be embedded within the larger scope of social commentary. \"Why do you do what you do? And, why do you feel the way you feel based on what you do?\" There's a psychological battle between doing something because it's \"good\" vs. Doing something because it provides opportunities, and then there's the sliver of possibility to intertwine the two of them. The family dynamic is the emotional crux of this story, showcasing moments that are abruptly raw and realistic while using connection as the focal point of transformation in Wright's character arc. The story is sharp, clever, and aware of the message that it's trying to share. In comparison to films with similar intentions, \"American Fiction\" leans heavily on the satirical tone to explore race and identity while visibly using comedy to approach the subject as universally as possible."

A huge one.Not painted on the large cinematic canvases of its likely Best Picture competitors like \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Barbie,\" \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" or \"Poor Things,\" director-co-writer Cord Jefferson's wise comedy scores its bull's-eyes on a life-size target, somewhere between the heart and the brain. The writing is brilliantly original, coming at well-worn black racial themes with eyes so fresh, you feel like you're seeing the subject for the first time.Jeffrey Wright carries the film, showing a side of himself often missing from past powerhouse dramatic performances. He's lovable ... despite the fact that his character doesn't know how to be. His Thelonius Ellison - you can call him \"Monk\" - is a prickly, Harvard-educated California university literature professor, author of several novels that no one, other than adoring academic critics, read.Earning its audacious title, \"American Fiction's\" plot is as well crafted as its metaphors. Before it's finished, black stereotypes and tone-deaf white efforts to embrace them have fallen under its satirical scalpel. So have the worlds of academia, publishing and Hollywood moviemaking. Its humor is smart and sly. It's no coincidence that Monk shares his last name with author Ralph Ellison, whose \"Invisible Man\" helped usher in the black American literary renaissance of the '50s and '60s.While its satire is spot on, at its heart the movie is really about family. Turns out Monk isn't the only \"doctor\" in his family. His sister Lisa (Tracee Ellis Ross) and brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) are physicians. The Ellisons are upscale enough to have a beach house as well as their big family home where matriarch Agnes (Leslie Uggams) is in the early stages of Alzheimer's All that brain power doesn't make them any less dysfunctional than other families. They just have wittier things to say about it.After Monk is drawn back to his family roots in Boston, his writing career takes an unexpected turn. What starts as a prank protest of \"authentic\" portrayals of black people in mainstream culture - notably by overnight-sensation black novelist Sintara Golden (Issa Rae) - inadvertently transforms Monk into a caricature himself. Which, to his dismay, is the path to the literary glory he has spent his life chasing.\"The dumber I behave, the richer I get,\" he complains to his agent (John Ortiz). (This isn't a spoiler - it's in the trailer.) Considering how intelligent the script is, it's ironic that a single word plays a crucial, and hilarious, role summing things up. You know the word - the one that begins with \"F.\" Watching \"American Fiction\" is richly rewarding, punctuated by laugh-out-loud moments steeped in real affection for its gently flawed characters. It has already picked up wins at early film festivals; expect plenty more nominations all around its cast and creators as awards season cranks into high gear.Its rich vein of empathy and compassion make for magnificent fiction. It truly is a work of literature as much as genius filmmaking.Watching it, I found myself uttering out loud, that word I mentioned above.For me it wasn't a curse at all, but a spontaneous expression of admiration, awe and pure joy."

(Kind of like 'don't judge a book by its cover.') In another review of this film, the reviewer used the word gloomy. But, do we not live in a gloomy world? Are we not surrounded by darkness? How many of us see the darkness? Isn't it well hidden behind modern day benefactors?!Quietly woven into the story or more questions - Is faith in God important? Can we pray our way out of difficult circumstances? Are we placing hope where we should place it or where we shouldn't? If we hold on to our faith in God during tough times, will we be blessed?Kristoffer Polaha did a fantastic job, as did all the other actors. Definitely worth watching. Go see this film and then go home and ponder it's many layers of meaning!"

That movie was The Shift, and the only regret I have from yesterday is that I did not pay enough.The Shift is so much better than many of the online reviews admit. It is deep, beautiful, powerful, action packed, suspenseful, and intriguing all at the same time. It is not your typical Christian movie, with all the preachy cheesy acting and low-budget constraints. This is a Hollywood-quality movie, with a cast filled with A-list actors and a crew filled with professionals.The movie isn't perfect, but its flaws are limited to some of the cuts being awkward and the CGI being better in some scenes than in others. Luckily, for most of the movie, the cinematography and special effects are just as great as the rest of the movie.Prepare to cry at the ending, as it is extremely powerful - and I've seen a lot of emotional movies, so I should know! You will not regret watching this movie; it is without a doubt the best movie Angel Studios has made yet. Don't listen to the negative Rotten Tomatoes reviews - most of which are written by atheists who hate any movie that please Him; go watch the movie yourself. Trust me; you too will leave the movie wishing you had paid more to see it."

Clearly, these did not diminish the rating I gave.First, I would have Kevin as being more righteous (Job was righteous in his generation). Second, I would tone down the multiverse stuff (but I'm 61, so what do I know). Finally, (big spoiler alert) I would not have erased Kevin and Molly's son.I highly recommend this movie. It felt as good as anything from the major studios. It had very good effects, lots of twists, and a racially diverse cast (which, when appropriate, I am a fan off).Go see it, and take a friend."

He brought truth to how the enemy comes in and doesn't let up.Elizabeth Tabish's portrayal of Molly Garner is stunning and beautiful.To be honest, from the leads to the extras everyone brought their A game and knocked it out of the park.This film brings so much hope and light.

Films that ask questions, that challenge us and provoke us and compel us to explore inner depths, those are the films we find ourselves contemplating and discussing long after the final credits have rolled.The Shift is one of these films.Written and directed by Brock Heasley and coming to us through Angel Studios, the production company best known for the groundbreaking television series, The Chosen, The Shift stays true to the spirit of its writer, director, and producers. It asks deep questions and makes bold decisions, pushing deep into a genre that is woefully under-represented in Christian art. While Marvel relentlessly releases film after film of cookie-cutter pablum, and the formerly beloved Star Wars franchise vomits out enough inferior recycled content to make us scream, \"enough already,\" Heasley and Angel Studios have created what will hopefully be will be the first of many original films-movies with that smaller independent touch that allow us to experience something new and engage in a dialog of issues vital to the human condition. This is an area where Science Fiction has historically been there to challenge us, yet most modern Hollywood blockbusters have abandoned that aspect while Christian films have frankly not even made an attempt.Until now.Led by outstanding performances from Neal McDonough, Kristoffer Polaha, and Elizabeth Tabish, The Shift will take you into a series of dystopian worlds, engaging in a universe-jumping ride in which the lead character, Kevin, contends with societal oppression, personal betrayal, and his most primal fears. Can Kevin find the courage and strength to fight through it all and find his way back to the woman he loves?The Shift is not a perfect film. There is a large amount of character- and world-building to be covered in 115 minutes, which leaves certain plot points and motivations underserved. While ambitious, the story could have benefited from a narrower focus. However, The Shift is highly entertaining, innovative, and thought provoking. It will engage you and challenge you. Brock Heasley and Angel Studios have created something fresh and important-a courageous, innovative, and risk-taking movie that requires a response, welcoming us into a genre and drawing us into a conversation we have too often avoided."

Anyone could see this film and glean something if they watch with anticipation and expecting the unexpected. The first 5 minutes I was unsure where they were headed, but after that I was intrigued all the way through. It was unlike anything I've ever seen and I was continually excited about what was going to happen next. There was an allegory for sure of the story of Job, but in a very cool yet subtle way. If you're highly visual like me, you'll love the feel of the film. The cinematography drew me in, but hands down the role of Kevin, played by Kris Polaha was amazing! He blew me away. Molly, played by Elizabeth Tabish was the ultimate leading lady! The energy between her and Kevin was captured perfectly. There was a lot of emotion in the film and Kris and Elizabeth nailed every scene! I think this film will cause a person to reflect on who they would actually be if really hard, impossible things, seemingly out of your control showed up randomly. Desperation causes people to make crazy decisions. Also, I think it's one of those films that could really cause a person to look in the mirror and ask themselves, \"what am I really made of?\" You can be a victim or a victor, but you can't be both. The Shift film name is perfect for the film. We can let the world shift us or we can decide to be believe in something bigger than ourselves. It's cool, slightly sci-fi, but ultimately it's kind of a wake up call to look at what's really important? The way they take you through the narrative is so unique, but a pleasant and intriguing surprise."

I would advise against bringing young children, as there is some violence during the movie, and young kids would probably not understand the storyline.There were some parts of the movie that I didn't understand, but this is not one of those movies that tells the entire story in an obvious way. For example, the coin Kevin spins in the beginning of the movie is a coin representing his sobriety, which he was about to throw away as he puts the beer to his lips. When Molly approaches, she also hints at her struggle with alcohol, which is later revealed and revisited in the movie.Overall, I thought the movie was very well done, especially since it was a freshman effort by Brock Heasley and Angel Studios.

It is a character study of our leading man Kevin Garner as he is tested by God to see if he will still have faith in him even if he's put through hell.Kristoffer Polaha does a pretty good job giving us a lead we can understand and feel for as he is basically on the brink of death everyday with only the thought of getting back to his wife keeping him going.Neal McDonough, as I predicted, chews up every scene he's in as The Benefactor and provides us with a villain that the audience can easily hate.To balance the serious story, Heasley gives us the characters of Gabriel and Russo (played by Sean Astin and John Billingsley respectively) as the comedic reliefs. I always got a chuckle when they were on screen.The idea of Satan using multiversal tech to cause conflict and chaos across the universe is so unique to me because I truly believe Satan would do something like that.There's so many small details that I love with my personal favorite being the changing of aspect ratios to tell you which universe Kevin is currently in.Brock Heasley's directorial debut doesn't overstay its welcome and leaves audiences with a memorable and groundbreaking achievement in Christian filmmaking.Angel Studios continues to lead the way of creative filmmaking as Hollywood continues to slowly kill itself with remakes and reboots.

Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of \"Captain Marvel\", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through \"The Marvels\", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be \"apathetic\", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original \"Captain Marvel\" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original \"Captain Marvel\" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series \"Ms. Marvel\", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as \"The Marvels\" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."

Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."

Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."

Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances.

The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."

Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought \"Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?\" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."

It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."

It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."

This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."

This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good.

I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical?

Zoom out on the early Avengers movies and you can see all that displayed because of Thanos. Some MCU movies do that better than others, and even a few DC movies nick it as well.

No one could even care about the villain or the vastly over used cats-eating-people to save them during a space station evac that didn't even need to be evacuated. That effect was cute and kinda jump-scary in the first move but should've stayed there.

That's the whole story. No twist endings. It adds nothing to the MCU timeline and could be/should be the death-knell for Capt Marvel. It's worthless and completely forgettable.

Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the \"Paul is dead\" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, \"The Marvels\" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like \"Wakanda Forever\" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."

                "content": "I don't follow the Internet fir all of the news about trouble production and reshoots etc...Bur when I saw the first trailer of The Marvels I had absolutely no desire to see it. Trailers usually are put together by marketing to make a film look as good as possible but I think in the case of this film they could not hide how utterly awful this film would be. I don't believe in criticizing a film if I do r see it so I went expecting the worst with the desire to at least be entertained. This was the worst 105 minutes I have spent in a movie theater in a long time. The MCU has gone from being a franchise that had so e great films but mostly solid, reliable and memorable films. Since Avengers: Endgame, only with a couple of exceptions, the MCU has gone completely downhill. With every film, they feel so generic, so done without the care that used to be made them so popular. Now, the difference is like night and day. They have become aggressively lazy and average films. Forgettable. But none of them had been complete failures on every level until The Marvels.There really is no story to talk about here. It is a sequel to Captain Marvel that i admit is one of the pre-Endgame films I liked the least. I didn't think Brie Larson was particularly bad as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel but there was nothing special about her in the role. Here it's obvious she wasn't right for the role. She has no charisma as the character, it felt like she was phoning in the performance. In fact that is the case for everyone in this film. It's a phoned in film. There is not a single character or situation to care about. A villain that is probably the worst ever in the MCU. It's just a series of mediocre action scenes put together with so e exposition dialogue thrown in to pad the runtime. At 105 mi it's it's short by MCU standards but it felt like 3 hours!!!Hands down, the worst MCU film ever!!!Grade: F."

She tries on her acting and drama and humour pants and found they didn't fit, so she just fumbles around and does a poor job.Rambo was introduced as an apologist for slavery and torture, got some kind of turning intangible thing going on which she got by walking for some reason, in a D+ show so she's probably new to most people.The bad guy was pathetic, the plan she sort of vaguely has, something to do with stealing an atmosphere for some reason to do something for some reason that wasn't made clear, to finish the plan of somebody but she doesn't say who that was, or what their plan was, and she is not in any way threatening. Her acting sucked also.The whole premise was idiotic. It could have been interesting if they had some kind of plan or plot before filming started instead of trying to fix it in post production, so what we got was sometimes three characters (one who fires light stuff, one who makes glowing purple stuff, and one who can apparently see light so she claimed in the script that her power is to not be blind) who sometimes switch places when they use their powers, but sometimes they don't.It's extremely inconsistent and only happens when convenient for the 'plot' or when some script writer with no sense of humour thinks it would be funny.Then lasers and flying around and fight scenes and some very sketchy CGI.And that's it. I tuned out for most of it, got bored after a while and so I can't remember most of what happened so I'll find out from a future Pitch Meeting who will do a much better job explaining the film than my semi-coherent rambling."

As a fan I would typically rate any Marvel film higher on IMDB because I want to see Marvel and the films succeed, but this one I rated a 4... I probably should have rated it a 3. If you went to see this movie and haven't kept up with all of the movies and Disney plus series, you will be scratching your head wondering what is going on. The Marvels is cringey in every possible way... the only part I enjoyed was the post credit scene. Marvel, please do better!

No, this is a contender for the worst mega budget, big studio, theatrically released film ever made. The tone veers from painfully unfunny attempts at slapstick humor to terribly acted \"this is most serious threat the world has ever faced\" moments that aim for gravitas but miss by miles, and sometimes these ridiculous tonal shifts occur in the same scene. Nothing makes sense, NOTHING. And that's the first 45 minutes before I had enough and left the theater and demanded a refund. I can't believe this script got a greenlight, let alone a $300 million budget. Speaking of which, where on this earth did all that money go? It certainly is not up on the screen as this is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen. Movies made in the 90s look a thousand times better than this catastrophe. I keep reading articles about why this movie is going to fail and they all got it wrong; three incomprehensibly unlikable leads, a nonsensical script, and a woefully incompetent director are why this movie is such a failure. The reviews that say this film is bad are wrong, but it's not the critic's fault; it's just that human language hasn't evolved a word strong enough to describe just how awful it truly is. I can still smell the stink of it on my clothes."

The messages of the album came across very well on screen and I was surprised by how well the documentary-style of the behind the curtain aspect was done.

The talent working in hand with production as well as her attention to detail has made an excellent film and I will be seeing this again in theaters.

                "content": "\"I have nothing to prove to anyone at this point,\" Beyoncé declares in her new tour documentary, Renaissance. Charting her record-breaking 2023 tour, this film offers an inside-look (written, directed and produced by Beyoncé) at the hive required to build something as extraordinary as those live performances. Because Beyoncé doesn't just put on a show. She puts on the show.It was blamed for the surprise rise in inflation in Sweden back in June. Combined with the equally dominating force of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, the Renaissance shows sent the US economy temporarily surging out of its pandemic slump. Around 2.7 million concertgoers attended Renaissance over the course of five months, while the tour is estimated to have grossed close to half a billion dollars. She's that girl.Beyoncé is supported by all manner of celebrity guests, including fellow pop titan Taylor Swift, who arrives in a sheath of silver. Inside, phones are stowed away in lockbags, while audience members are handed champagne, salted popcorn and Smarties (British chocolate, nice touch). Then, gasps as the woman of the moment (of the year, of the decade!) walks onstage and thanks those who followed her \"formal opulence\" dress code to the letter.\"Thank you for coming, thank you for dressing up,\" she says, adding how proud she feels that the film is released on World Aids Day, in honour of her late uncle Jonny. \"Feel free to dance, sing, cry... thank you.\"For anyone who doubts the neccessity of a concert film, well, prepare to stand corrected. This isn't just a highlights reel. It's a rare and remarkable look at the staggering, Spielberg-style production that goes into putting on a show like Renaissance.Each two-and-a-half hour event involves myriad costume and set changes, a full troupe of dances, and a setlist spanning the 41-year-old's career to date, from her Destiny's Child days to her surprise 2013 album, Beyoncé, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary in two weeks. Renaissance the album, released last year, pays dazzling homage to the Black and queer pioneers of post-Seventies house and disco while also celebrating her own sexual liberation. Songs such as \"I'm That Girl\" and \"Cuff It\" are delivered in a luxurious murmur, like a big cat stretching its limbs out after a good meal. \"You hate me,\" she purrs on \"Cozy\"... \"because you want me.\"\"When I am performing, I am nothing but free,\" she says in the Renaissance film. \"The goal for this tour is to create a place where everyone is free, and no one is judged. Unique.\" Regardless of this, it is impossible to deny that Beyoncé has harnessed a level of perfectionism we rarely see in any art form. Not since Prince has a musician wielded such control over their live show. Whether she's exhibiting vocal gymnastics on \"Dangerously in Love\" or rising into the air on a silver horse while wearing a diamond-encrusted harness (Lady Godiva meets Studio 54), everything appears flawless.To achieve this, production has to be handled with the utmost precision. Beyoncé spent four years working with choreographers, designers, crew, sound engineers, medics, security and caterers in the build-up to the tour's launch in Stockholm, Sweden, on 10 May. \"In order to perform as many times as we perform, we have three stages,\" she explains at one point in the film. \"As one is getting set up, the other two stages are travelling to the next city and getting built.\" Watching women and men dangle from harnesses, assembling giant installations and working out complex floor plans, is like watching an entirely new city being built in real time.Beyoncé allows no room for error. Far from painting her as the benevolent queen, Renaissance shows her in all her business and creative glory. She grills her camera crew: why can't they find a wider lense? Even when there are mistakes, she turns them into new triumphs. The sound cuts out: she seizes the opportunity for yet another dramatic outfit change.Once the concert begins, for the audience it's a case of blink-and-you'll-miss-it. Dancers whirl around the stage; a disco ball descends from the rafters; Beyoncé rides in on a lunar rover while her 11-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, dances in front. The tempo and sheer spectacle of it all leaves you breathless. No one compares."

Building on the formidable foundation set by 'Homecoming,' this film elevates every aspect: cinematography, sound design, and insightful documentary footage. Personally, having experienced the Renaissance World Tour live, I can attest that the film authentically captures, and at times, surpasses the concert's brilliance.The sound design is a revelation. Witnessed in IMAX, it's an auditory spectacle. The bass reverberates through your body, while Beyoncé's vocals are a perfect blend of power and warmth. I don't think I've ever head Beyoncé sound better, even in a live setting.What surprised me was the emotional depth in the documentary segments. Unlike previous works, 'Renaissance' delves deep into Beyoncé's familial bonds, the album's inspiration, and the particularly arduous planning and rehearsal phases. It's more than just a behind-the-scenes look; it's a journey into the soul of the project, sharing the spotlight with those who inspired and contributed to this monumental experience.The concert footage is simply breathtaking. Regardless of personal opinions about Beyoncé, her ability to deliver an unmatched live performance is undeniable. The film magnifies this brilliance with its stellar camera work, editing, and sound design. The film rips through concert dates, in Everything Everywhere All At Once style editing, and the fashion explodes onto the screen. So many colours and expert concert lighting, it all just looks and sounds so incredible. It's impossible not to be sucked into this experience.'Renaissance' is a testament to the evolution of concert films, much like Beyoncé has redefined live performance throughout her career. This film is a transformative experience, leaving me as exhilarated as when I attended in person. It's a must-see, not just for fans of Beyoncé, but for anyone who appreciates groundbreaking artistry in music and film."

But honestly, I can't see anyone at the very least matching Beyonce in Sheer Routine Skill, Bodily Movement & Ability, Coupled with Singing Ability.Renaissance by Beyonce -1.🦄 At 42 years old, she still looks good.2. 🎥 The Cinematography of the Songs was Good and in Certain Moments, it was Shocking. Her movements at multiple times within the film were just outstanding.2a. There was a Scene when she's just going full force and her movements were Lightning Fast ⚡ and the colour and Lighting of her Costume changed. It was literally Mesmerising to Watch 😳.2b.

One of those was the Robot Movements with her Backup Dancers along side her, if you blink, you would literally miss the Snappy Movements.3.💖 The film had good Edits during the Songs and also it was good to see the backstage segments of what she was going through in preparation and her sheer drive in her Mentality to help produce the best possible show she could deliver.4. 🌠 Beyonce was always so Skillful in her Dancing Routines and Singing, but Man, after seeing it loud and direct in Dolby Cinema, what a Performer she is! At this point, she really is a Living Legend.5.💍 She Had Beautiful Costumes throughout the film6. 💎 The different Stage Screen Themes and Layout was Great to See.Overall, one of the Top films of 2023, one of those Films I will Remember, it was an Energetic, Insightful and Beautiful Watch.💫"

                "content": "LIKES:The Sound Quality -Let's get the obvious out of the way and talk about how the theater really maximizes the sound quality in this experience.-A concert requires this be on point, and Beyonce's guidance did not fail to deliver room shaking bass, engaging beats, and q musical storm that shakes the clothes.-Fantastic editing to make sure every sound stays balanced and heard, beautiful support of her vocals, and these background effects kept me ingrained, illustrating a great use of the art of sound making to the highest quality yet.-To even use a trick about a concert snafu and ingraining that...stellar design and clever tricks that really impressed me.The Camera Angles: -You want to feel like you are in the concert and experiencing it from every angle? Then again, props to the editing and film crew of this piece.-Renaissance does great things with the guidance of the camera work, constantly moving around to give you the whole stage timed beautifully to help enhance musical number -Shots of Beyonce's props, key dancing moments and instrument playing, a balance of wide and focused angles, and even crowd views, all achieve a goal of integration that takes this movie to higher levels of concert conversion.-Alongside good filters, high quality imaging, with ingraining a camera phone filming perspective , the movie accomplished for me, an experience that felt like \"I'm there\".The Songs: -I have not been on the tour, nor do I know most of her work outside local radio the last few years, but the concert has a lot of her new edge that other audience members were dancing to.-It's got great power, a live presence that matched the studio recording with clear vocals, and killer stage presence that helps somehow enhance the musical presence of the movie.-So, for fans of her music, you are going to really enjoy what the Queen and her cast, especially her sound engineers, really accomplished much in this regards.The Choreography: -You may not like the music, you may not like the dancers, but it's going to be hard to not give them props for some insane dance numbers they put on in this show.-The control these people have in their bodies with this strength to pull off these taxing movies was impressive to me A few members had my favorite moves, doing so much with stamina and movement really brought something to the stage just past her singing.-Hip hop and Pop and Lock reign the dominant style for me, but the way they keep the coordination and mood, adjust for the angles, and integrate so much into the performance... quite awesome in helping add that concert atmosphere.The Special Effects: -While certainly more impressive in person, Beyonce has brought a stellar show of her stage effects to the silver screen -Laser light show are just the base of this piece, a really cool light effect that does some wicked tricks with the computer screen and the air that would be stellar to see.-Pyrotechnics accomplish much in the way of a contained firework show, helping to give contrast and framing to the impressive props she rides around the stage.-And of course, the massive screen behind her holds character, albeit weird for me, that transitions into some of the coolest stage designs I've seen in a long time. A fine fit of technology with real life effects accomplished much for this reviewer and may be one of the best aspects for theater viewing.The Costumes: -I can't' say most of the outfits were my cup of tea in terms of sexual prowess. But fI was impressed at the designs holding up to the demanding performances.-Color's are bold, alongside a lot of texture based designs with shiny rhinestones, very silky material, and unique prints that are original, matching the energy of the performance and eye catching.-They hold up well to the demanding moves of the wearers, look great in a lot of the lighting, and match the leader's unique outfit with coordination that I find amazing by the design team.-And as this is a concert film, the editing gives you plenty of time with all styles, transitioning the moment on the show to essentially swap the costumes rapidly as if paper dolls were their canvas.The Editing: -Another nod from me, the editing accomplishes a lot with the effects to take all the things above and bring them together in a very engaging piece.-The costume tricks alone were impressive, but there was so much more to the film, a logical presentation of shots and elements to make me feel like VIP concert member.-Alongside picking key moments, there was a great combination of the tour, and parts of the nonconcert material, it helps give you this documentary/concert that has personality and tries to give one the \"full\" experience. Only tripping a few points.The Behind The Scenes: -Perhaps my favorite part of this piece, the behind the scenes was perfect for a geek like me to see how it all comes together to make this giant spectacle.-Construction of the show, the costumes, and the planning took my favorite spot, just seeing so many people coordinating with Beyonce to make this show.-For those who are big on the current movements, you have plenty of praise and representation in this film and even have messages that the queen wants to share that hold the vibes of the concert.-And for those who put the artist on Olympian Goddess level, you'll get more than enough time with her struggles and attitude to the artistry. Some of these, were inspiring for me, primarily seeing the hard work in planning the show and her family history that explains a lot.DISLIKES:Less Editing On Numbers: -Going to a concert, I like to see the whole song like some artists have done, and this movie cut a fair number of songs midway through their performance.-While some of these were brilliant cuts, some of my favorite songs were interrupted too soon for me and I really wanted to se them to closure and what she could cap them with her magical touch.-If this is a concert movie, I kind of wanted a bit more focus on that, including more time with the band shots that sometimes got lost to the other angles.-In addition, I don't need to see about a fourth of the movie flashing to the fans at the concerts. I get it's about unity, and there is a message, but again, I'm here for the concert numbers, where my audience involvement is my fellow theater attendants.The Beyonce Glorification: -My favorite behind the scenes stuff is seeing the hard work of this woman and the planning of the show, seeing the strength to balance work and family to A levels.-But past that point, the movie's portrayal of her personal life and pride did little for a regular person like me.The film felt very edited/social media like, highlights, fake phrasing, and very dramatic messaging that does not do much for me, that it took away from the things I was enjoying seeing.-That effect carried over into the background dancers' tales as well, and though the cultural feel is there, the doctoring and dramatic telling just feel a bit too pushed for me.-And of course, if you aren't a fan of the attitude, you aren't going to like some of the aggressive lines used at times, as it's a very big focus on her new persona which is just not what I like about Beyonce.Too Sexualized: -My concerts of choice are about the music, the dancing, and perhaps not fully on sexual imagery and attitude.-This was not the song list for me, nor the show, with Beyonce's new direction being very aggressive, very big on inviting poses, and lyrics that beat this drum to death.-No shame to anyone who likes this. It's just not the concert experience I particularly like, preferring her previous shows and albums to this show where body, anger, and attitude lyrics are the primary focus.-The message she says is important about loving yourself and pride, but I just felt this movie did not take the best approach to presenting it, going again more PSA than performance.-As the shots showed, the movie was who love her new work and agree whole heartedly with the message, you won't find this a dislike at all, but approaching from a general point, this is again going to be a warning and limitation.The VERDICT: Another win in the concert experience, Beyonce's Renaissance accomplishes much in the way of documentary with musical concert experience. Sensational effects are the thing that won me over to stay in this long movie, seeing so many great shots of wonderful stage effects that really make a theater the optimum way. To build alongside the performance really was impressive to me, and the constant angle changes and editing really optimize the viewing experience. Throw in a wonderful sound editing to help make sure you get everything, alongside creative choices, and well, it's hard not to give props to the work at hand. Alongside an experience of the behind the scenes, including glimpses into her life, well, the Beyonce fan is easily going to give this a 9 or a 10. For me though, the movie doesn't have the song variety of other concerts, focusing more on aggressive sexualization and other political topics that do little for a reviewer like me. When the glimpses are doctored of her life to sometimes fuel that fire, the concert escapism is lost and a regular Joe like me loses the enjoyment despite the message trying to be conveyed. From all of this, my score is difficult to put, but as I'm going for movie overall vs. Concert personification, the scores are going to vary based on how different the media are:Music/Concert/Documentary: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 5.0."

Blue Ivy Carter will be a force to reckon with, I was disheartened to hear that she knew of the nasty comments written about her performance BUT I was so proud she decided to rehearse everyday and get better to prove her haters wrong.

Beyoncé effectively highlights various tour outfits, performance venues, and audience reactions, incorporating concert segments, docuseries elements, and almost music video-like scenes.

Her other project were varying degrees of good but this is well thought out, cohesive piece of work. I love how she interwove so many different aspects of into the movie: Working Mother, Wife, Performer, Woman, Black, LGBTQ+ ally, Injuries, Business owner, Musician, Creative, Leader, etc. It just felt good through and through. She has come a long way from a directorial perspective and it is very nice to see. I hope she continues in this vein. Brava Beyonce!"

Feeling more inspired and liberated than ever, it's like Queen Bey reached through the screen and ignited a fire of self-acceptance in my soul. The way she champions gay pride in the film makes me feel seen and included, turning the concert into a personal celebration of identity. And can we talk about her work ethic? It's not just inspiring; it's a whole mood. Beyoncé is not just an icon; she's a beacon of empowerment and fierce self-love, and this film captures every fabulous moment. 🌈✨"

                "content": "Beyoncé is an interesting singer as while I am not a big fan of hers, I have enjoyed a couple of her songs in the past and some of her movie roles she had done. This documentary explores her Renaissance World Tour and the behind the scenes moments and there are some pretty good camerawork and discussions about the event. Including some gorgeous color presentations and uses of the music and soundtrack that helps to build the narrative and setting. But because I am not emotionally invested with her previous work \"Homecoming\" or \"Black Is King\" and her musical works, I felt both interested and bored watching this.I mentioned there are good discussions explored about the creation of her album and the tour but there are discussions that dragged quite a bit or felt like they went nowhere. With the interviews and guests featured, there are some guests that were interesting but some guests that didn't really impacted the discussions and felt a bit awkward since their discussions and interviews felt a bit cringeworthy and slightly got on my nerves. With the movie being the runtime of 168 minutes, the pacing is pretty uneven and certain scenes felt unnecessary. I understand the heart and passion of what Beyoncé is trying to communicate but I just wasn't emotionally connected with it. I gave this one a watch since I like to give all kinds of movies a chance but just like Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, it's not for me.Overall, Beyoncé is one talented singer and actress/filmmaker but I didn't emotionally connect with the documentary. I do recommend it for Beyoncé fans tho."

                "content": "I'm pretty open minded when it comes to music so went into this with no expectations. I do know some of Beyonce's older music with Destiny's Child and the likes of her big hits Halo and Single Ladies.The first 10 minutes seemed fine. It is pretty much the start of one of Beyonce's concerts and her excellent vocals are on form. I thought I will enjoy this if the entire near 3 hour film is like this. The only thing I noticed what I thought was weird was the different takes of the same songs edited together, this is clear from the changing of day to night time setting but above all Beyonce's constant wardrobe changes. Fine, I could up with that niggle but it definitely became irritating later on.However then the haphazardness starts. We constantly switch between 10 or so minutes of concert footage and either backstage rehearsal footage or Beyonce reflecting on where she is in her private life (even whilst flying on a private jet - ugh) etc. It does not interest me anywhere near as much as watching what an artist can do best. Maybe as some extra footage on a Blu Ray or a separate documentary this would have been great but intertwining this with concert footage, I'm not sure is a good idea. It didn't work for me. Seeing Beyonce's backstage stuff could be interesting. Maybe as a 10-15 minute intro and after that just present an entire single concertI wanted to get back to the concert every time the backstage / private footage parts were shown...However, that turned out to be disappointing as well. The music became exceptionally monotonous, as if you are in a club all evening. Almost every song appeared to be about sex / I'm a strong female, included twerking and had no live band (I think I saw them on stage for about 5 songs). So we are reduced to listening to samples, many voice intro tracks and I guess a tape for music. I recognised two songs: Partition (not exactly a good song) and probably her biggest early solo hit: Crazy in Love. This is astonishing considering Beyonce's large early back catalogue. But I guess it has been left in the past. Which is a shame.There is also some time spent on a concert power malfunction. Maybe interesting to some but I'm not sure it's relevant.Bringing her 11 year old daughter on stage I think is bizarre considering the quite adult subject matter of Beyonce's music during most of the show. But it's up to her. Just weird seeing her daughter's mother near naked riding (both literally and figurative speaking) a tank like vehicle in the background.Maybe Beyonce feels the need to stay relevant with only doing modern club music and pushing sexual boundaries that she has done for over 20 years. It seems somewhat tiring to me to watch for so long.Now some of the visuals and props are excellent, there is no denying. There is a spectacular show there somewhere. However if it is not firstly and mostly about good music, I simply lose interest and I don't care what spectacle you bring to the table.The music is pretty drab and lacks different textures to say the least.Like where Beyonce is currently at, I had little knowledge of Taylor Swift's recent music as well a few months ago, but I thought her Eras concert film was far more digestible for an average music enthusiast and in fact I ended up watching it several times at the cinema. I also added some of Swift's songs to my music playlists. It says enough. Thus when Beyonce's film came around I thought I'd give it a shot too. But it's very, very different, and not in a good way.I doubt I could sit through Renaissance again. Even the first time felt like too much.I thus cannot recommend this film at all but to the die hard Beyonce fans who like her recent music. They will probably like this a lot, sure."

Oppenheimer is definitely up there as one of the best movies of the year, but quite honestly, it pales in comparison to Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé as it relates to the sheer audaciousness and meticulousness of the editing, costume design, stage design, production, and direction. No doubt, Beyoncé will not get a tenth as much credit as Christopher Nolan despite writing, producing, and directing her movie. But oh boy, does she deserve to. Both movies are similar length, but where Renaissance's runtime feels much less than it is, Oppenheimer's felt longer.Now, I am no Beyoncé fan (I was dragged along by someone that is) and I was frankly filled with much trepidation going to see it, but I am glad I did. There is no way you can watch this movie and not leave feeling at least somewhat inspired and awed by Beyoncé's talent and the overall experience.It is a truly thrilling experience and it gave me a newfound respect for Beyoncé and her work ethic. I left feeling inspired and feeling as though I had possibly just seen the greatest to ever do it, something which I could not have envisioned saying before the movie.If you have sons and daughters, please take them to see this movie. Not only is it a concert, but it infuses itself with backstage footage and the preparation that went into the Renaissance tour. You get to see how someone at the top of their craft navigates the obstacles and challenges of putting on a project of this magnitude by being blunt and direct when needed, and yet still doing so with exemplary grace. You have to respect the way Beyoncé handles herself, considering she is one of the most famous and powerful women in the world. What a fantastic role model.Ultimately, I highly recommend this movie to anyone. I can honestly say I have not had more fun at a movie theatre in a long time.10/10."

                "content": "John Woo's Violent, Silent Night is a Bold Experiment That Works. While John Woo's new film, which hits theaters December 1st, has many elements that embody the reasons international action film fans idolize him, it has one character trait that is distinct from other Woo films. In fact, it is unique from all modern, full length movies. That feature is that the film has no dialogue. When I use the phrase \"no dialogue\" it is not hyperbolic to mean limited dialogue. There is, literally, no dialogue, at all.While this bold cinematic experiment could have been disastrous, it was not. In fact, it is critical to the film's appeal. This unique perspective, actually, elevates this film to a higher art form, without ever losing the raw grit and violent, action thrills that are at its core. The film's success lies in the fact that it is so well made, and the acting is so thoughtfully constructed, that the audience never longs for what does not even seem to be missing-spoken words. After viewing this one I had to remind myself that there was no dialogue. That is a tribute to the solid storytelling throughout Silent Night.Joel Kinnaman stars in, and does much of the heavy lifting, in this one. Kinnaman, a relative unknown to American movie audiences, is the fulcrum around which the entire weight of the film rests. His stellar ability to solidly convey to the audience his angst and despair over the murder of his son, and his laser pointed focus in avenging his death without words is what propels the film from an ordinary action film to an extraordinary one. This is a solid performance that happens to be in an action film, and not in spite of it.Catalina Sandino Moreno does an equally powerful job balancing the emotions of being the mother of a murdered son, who can not seem to break through the forcefield which is surrounding her husband's emotional descent. Moreno is the heart of the film, for sure.John Woo is known for his masterful Direction of action sequences. His, The Killer (1989), is considered one of the best action films of the 20th Century. This film builds on his distinguished body of work with jaw dropping vehicular chase scenes, chaotic shootouts, and visceral hand to hand exchanges. These are filmed with magnetic precision, and the elimination of shaky-cam effects, leading to a riveting result.While the film has the traditional martial arts theme of revenge, Kinnaman's lack of the conventional training of John Wick, Taken's Bryan Miller, and Nobody's Hutch Mansell is an asset to the film. His attempt to elevate his physical body and fighting skills to be able to obliterate his enemies is part of the film's brutal realism. This one is extremely violent, but it is all part of the roller coaster ride. He is a man driven by a singular cause, and we feel his pain.The entire supporting cast here does an admirable job of telling their part of the story. They are very good. The villains are, certainly, a little over the top here, but that makes their demise so much more satisfying.Marco Beltrani's musical score is as much a character in the film as any member of the cast. Music in movies is an important element of the storytelling; however, not all scores have the same level of importance. Perhaps, because of the lack of dialogue here, the score is vital and it does its job effectively.The real question on my mind as I left the NYC screening was, \"Like Die Hard, will people be debating whether Silent Night is, actually, a Christmas movie for years to come.\" While I am not sure of the answer to that question, I do know that John Woo's, Silent Night, is a winner. This Lionsgate release is greater than the sum of its parts. It is one of the best action films of the year, and I highly recommend it."

Instead of using the idea of a dialogueless action flick as an interesting device he creates a very drab story that is less than appealing. He makes little effort in trying interesting ways to propel the story within the confines he set up. It's like he never watched a silent movie and saw how you can tell a compelling story with minimal dialogue. He just leans on lame cliches. Also there's too many logocal errors, even for an action movie. And Joel Kinnaman, who I normally like, makes a less than appealing protagonist. Even without speaking his character seems annoying. An unfortunate misfire from something that had a lot of potential."

As I said, it looks great visually, but the action choreography is a bit lame, because gangsters get shot and stabbed and just keep on figthing as if nothing has even touched them. Pretty lame.More bad: the leading actor hasnt got any charisma. He looks like a dork, a nerd.

John Woo's disappointing action revenge flick with Kinnaman seeking vengeance on gangbangers who accidentally killed his son on Christmas has so much potential but is squandered in its hole-laden script by Robert Archer Lynn (i.e. Namely the sadly misused talent of Sandino Moreno as the spouse who basically just passively cries while her husband for months on end is holed up in their basement preparing for war). While Kinnaman's character is literally silenced due to his being shot in the throat renders him mute and his impressive implosive performance can't make up for the pedestrian trope-laden story (i.e. The police not doing their job). A few decent set pieces sadly cannot make up for a half-baked update on DEATH WISH and its ilk."

                "content": "\"Silent Night\" is the new action revenge thriller from Hong Kong action legend, John Woo. At 77 years old, he hasn't lost touch with the genre and delivers his style of operatic kinetic action sequences that don't displease. However, the action sequences and Joel Kinnaman's performance is the only thing good about the movie. Predictable is one thing, but the movie is the same action movie we have seen before with a revenge aspect.Set at Christmas time, Brian (Joel Kinnaman,) and his wife Saya (Catalina Sandino Moreno,) lose their only son to a stray bullet after two rival gangs shoot from cars at each other in their neighbourhood. Brian chases them down, and he's shot in the throat. The title, \"Silent Night,\" Is because it's a silent movie with almost no dialogue, and that is where the film's biggest problems lie. Brian not speaking adds something different to the film as he uses facial expressions to convey feelings or the situations he finds himself in.Brian chases the gang members down and he is shot in the throat by Playa (Harold Torres,) a typical gang member with tattoos on his face. He shoots Brian, who recovers in the hospital, losing his ability to speak and discovering that his son has died. When he returns home, he hits the bottle and becomes engrained with revenge. He marks on the calendar the day he is going after the gang members while his wife watches him drink like a fish and lose himself, not knowing what to do or how to help him.Nobody speaks a word in the film. The only dialogue is from radio transmissions from Police chatter and that's it. Characters get punched, struck by a car or they scream when they are shot. There are some scenes of text between Brian and his wife but this doesn't further the plot because we know what kind of movie this is. A means to an end. There is an emotional story here but everyone is useless along with the gang who are going to get violently blown away by running right into the bullets.Brian is so filled with revenge. Joel Kinneman plays this well. Method acting in the mirror trying to scream, and you see the rage. He armours his car, learns to use a knife and becomes efficient at using handguns. He plans a date on the calendar when he is going after them. In the meantime, he becomes cold towards his wife, conducts surveillance on the gang leader responsible and hands the case to a cop, Detective Vassal (Kid Cudi) who is useless because his silence takes away from the idea that Brian was shot in the throat and can't talk but this guy can talk. How his character unfolds is one of the dumbest aspects of the movie.In the second act of the movie, I figured out the ending, and I was correct. You know that moment where it just clicks because you have seen it before, and where can the story go after this? There is no second story for a character like this.Brian sinks deeper into mania until one year passes, and he loads up every gun he has and puts on a bulletproof vest. His plan is to kill them all and he executes it almost flawlessly. But when you see Playa and his dumb girlfriend, he keeps on heroin, dancing, it just drags because it's all sound and noise. Saya sees she can't help anymore and the tight close-ups of her tears there make you feel for their situation. It is heartbreaking to see but when Brian is about to become a one-man army, how are we supposed to feel when he is simply another vigilante?First, he uses a car to spin around the thugs and shoots them all, al la \"John Wick,\" and then he appears on a motorcycle and shoots his way inside. Playa sends more of his goons after him and the idea of the grieving father is here, but because we don't hear anything from anyone, it's hard to convince feelings towards the characters, especially the dumb cop. He blasts his way through Playa's Batman-like skyscraper leading to the staircase sequence and eventually to Playa.\"Silent Night\" has great action sequences, but we have seen this before. Joel Kinneman is great, and the story is tragic and violent, but at the heart of it is vengeance which is used as an excuse for bullets to fly and cars to crash in glorious fashion. There is an emotional message about fatherhood here, and when tragedy strikes, what do you do? \"Death Sentence\" by Kevin Bacon conveyed this message much better, and I thought a lot about it while watching this movie because it's very similar right down to the story, but that was a better movie.5/10."

He now tries to do the same again by using almost no real dialogue in this film, apart from some background dialogue from music and news radio.Joel Kinnaman has to work more with facial expressions and body postures to act. He does this well, but if there had been a little more dialogue at the beginning of the film, the story could have been a bit clearer. Due to the lack of speech, the film can sometimes remain unclear. Catalina Sandino Moreno plays his wife and mother of the child who died. She knows how to portray a good, supporting role. Unfortunately, she fades into the background halfway through the film, during the father's revenge campaign. Kid Cudi plays a cop in the film who tries to investigate the attack on the father and son, but he still comes across as more in another film. If they had left his character out of the movie, the movie could have been a bit shorter and clearer.The story remains a standard revenge action film, in which characters, for personal reasons, want to take revenge on people who have harmed or taken something away from them. This film is somewhat reminiscent of John Wick's Deadpool, only with less humor or similar action.There are entertaining action scenes in this film, but unfortunately they are not that special and not at all for a Jon Woo action comeback. The action scenes do have some creative moments with good visual effects. Unfortunately, not all of the effects even look significant. Some explosions seem less realistic. The blood that characters get during the action scenes also sometimes looks more like fake CGI blood than it looks real."

                "content": "First and foremost, this movie will not be for everyone simply because it is mostly dialogue-free. Truly silent, minus a few bits of radio chatter and music with action sound effects. This is what sets it apart from other revenge flicks, though, and part of the reason why it is fresh, but also a little problematic. It has to get to the action as quickly as it can, but needs to fill the run time, so has a shaky first half, albeit a very rewarding second half.Many movies, especially from the past 10 years, start twenty minutes later than movies used to begin. Character building is lost because we are thrown into the action. For this to truly work, on a quick popcorn movie, the film would have to be just over an hour. Since we are over that theoretical minimum of 90 minutes, there's a chunk of slow-moving scenes at the start. We get hit over the head with the reasoning behind the vengeance, and it's done in a slow, no dialogue way. Once you get past this, then you can settle in for some very good action scenes! Luckily these action scenes are rewarding enough to deal with a frustratingly unlikeable hero and a shallow supporting cast.I could definitely see rewatching this, but only for the practical action that is very well directed. Some people may not get far enough into the movie appreciate some John Woo thrills, but if you give it 30 minutes (or chapter skips), then it's very worth your time."

                "content": "John Woo is a filmmaker I admittedly haven't seen a tonne of work from, but he undeniably has a vision for action sequences. That is what he is known for and he has stuck to that throughout most of his career in the business. Face/Off and Hard Boiled are awesome action films, so if I ever get the chance, I'll check out his latest. Well, Silent Night is his latest American effort and I must say, he hasn't lost his touch with action. With that said though, it was just okay overall. It has a lot of promise and some great ideas, but something bogged it down for me. Here are my thoughts.After a gang accidentally kills the son of a couple just trying to live a happy life, the husband, Godlock (Joel Kinnaman) decides to go after them. He ends up shot in the neck, preventing him from ever speaking a word again. His mission then becomes to train his body to take on this gang and kill them all. The unique aspect of this film is the fact that it is told entirely without dialogue. Not a single one of the characters speaks one word. I enjoyed that aspect, but I do wish it was utilized more than just having nobody speak. Nothing was interesting past the point of just not having him talk. It was clear that Woo just wanted to focus on the action and that was worth the price of admission.There wasn't a lot of originality in terms of the action set pieces, but it was all very well-choreographed. From a standout fight that takes place in a house, to a great stairwell scene, the action held my attention. With that said, the good aspects of this film are bogged down by the sappy nature of the backstory. The way his past with his child is presented is kind of cheesy at first and there is a specific moment towards the end of the film that almost made me chuckle when it was clear the film was trying to be very emotional. The schmaltz of it all overtook the film and ruined a few moments.Joel Kinnaman is an actor I like very much and his performance here is quite solid, but I'm not sure he was given enough to do, other than either be incredibly angry or sad. It's a very thin story and screenplay and the final product shows that. Still, if you enjoy action, there is enough here to satisfy viewers. The absent dialogue is a great idea, but this type of film needed some in my opinion. Silent Night is a little too cheesy at times, but I still think it's worth a watch if you are already interested. Now playing in theatres, there are worse options to watch than this one."

And it is awesome, now if you went in expecting a dang Tyler perry drama Plat, you will be disappointed, but otherwise you should love it, john wick fell into John woo's grieving father's revenge story script. And it works very well. Reminds me a lot of crank as well, another franchise that deserved a sequel. Hopefully people support it so maybe we can get more like it. I love we are getting more holiday themed movie's that are not just corny comedys or dramas that you forget as soon as your done watching it, never to be watched again, but movie's like this, the recent Thanksgiving, krampus, and further back trick r treat, are awesome holiday movie's that can be watched over and over. Speaking of sequels, those last 2 definitely need them.Brilliant movie and like nothing I've ever experienced. Action scenes were spot on and the emotion was strong without any dialogue. Great work by John Woo and the incredible actors.6/5 making things accurate.11/10 this is what you should have done."

                "content": "Can you make an awesome Gun-Fu flick but have nobody talk? Absolutely. And who else to do it but the legendary Hong Kong Action Guru John Woo. I went into the film blind, and oddly enough I had watched John Woo's magnum opus, Hard Boiled, for the millionth time about a week ago and while thematically, it is significantly different, I still liked it. I grew up as a child watching the relentless Hong Kong classics on VHS in the 90's, and while some may soon be saying it didn't reach those heights. I don't think it was supposed to it.This was a quite interesting experiment of combining character study and an explosive Gun-Fu action flick. I must say, it worked much better than I anticipated it would. This was a wholly unique movie in a sea of the same old boring action movies (insert 500 movies in the last 5 years). In fact, the trailers before the film were literally the stale Jason Statham, solo action hero BS that this film amazing breaks free from to provide a fun and special experience. The action was not quite Hard Boiled extremes, but it was well choreographed. The acting was good enough to convey a story with no words. Thumbs up, fun movie for a change, the movie landscape seems to be changing.People should also remember how frequently John Woo has commented on many of things I have a feeling younger folks, or folks new to his work, will soon complain about. He acknowledges that nobody reloads their weapons because it \"interrupts the flow of the action\", the enemy couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat (people shooting 2 feet away from each other and hitting nothing). There needs to be a suspension of disbelief for Woo films, and there have been for decades, just relax, and enjoy the violence.While I am getting sick of CGI car accidents (I saw that in another different movie very recently but can't remember), and the digital blood and wish there would be a return to the classic use of practical effects. I miss the 90's and all its paper/debris flying, squib orgies, and people actually hitting each other. But this film does have the classic practical effects to a large degree and while the digital effects would be my only complaint. I REALLY liked this and would recommend."

                "content": "Hated this film, most tedious action movie ever. It oversells the opening credits death of his son. While I understand it's the crux of the motivation, we get 30 minutes of his suffering before he decides to do a thing. Feels emotionally manipulative, wringing every last drop of milk from the tragedy to the point where it can't be called a fun action film in the least. The entire film is dialogue free, which works for him since he loses his voice, but becomes a big, dumb gimmick as every character in the film is given an excuse not to speak. One is gagged, one cries and texts the entire film, one is simply quiet and stoic and the rest grunt and groan to fill the gaping void. So finally, after a long cliched montage of him body building and gun training (and why he needs to be extra ripped I don't understand, but I'll buy it). He has a year to plan the perfect revenge and what does he do? Drives up, makes a lot of noise, makes every mistake imaginable & is constantly getting beat up and luck saves him every single time. Bad guys aim for his bullet proof vest over and over again, they give him long cool looks instead of just shooting him as he loudly makes himself an eye sore in every situation, never using even the smallest amount of stealth. He decides not to shoot a woman who just unambiguously just shot at him to kill him, which obviously doesn't go well for him. He tells the bad guys he's coming for him and is surprised that they best him. The lead bad guy decides to dance with his girl for like 10 minutes in slow motion as he is killing all his guys in what is possibly the most over decorated art direction ever in a movie... his lair looks like a groovy Los Angeles art installation or something meow wolf would dream up, hardly a gang member's decorating style. He sees his son in things and plays with his toys over and over stopping the action in its tracks. And finally, why are all the gang members cliches from 1990's movies? Why are they squatting and squaring off in abandoned ruins of buildings? Don't they have anywhere better to be? This movie was a boring, ridiculous, mess. John Woo tried his best to make it interesting visually, but the hyper style that worked in films like Face/Off never stops and makes it feel even more dramatically over the top."

                "content": "As a John Woo fan I really thought this was going to be his comeback. The concept was so cool, and the trailer looked so good. I genuinely felt like this had so much potential and I was so excited to see it realized. I kept imagine how intense sequences of pure action must be without any interruption of dialogue. I kept imagining the unique focus on the visuals and sounds to replace the work of the dialogue. Mr. Robot pulled off a thrilling episode with no dialogue, so surely this movie could've too. Truly there was so much that could've been done and this would've been a classic. Unfortunately that trailer literally showed the best moments, and not much was done with the concept.All they really had to do was follow the John Wick blueprint but focus more on the visual storytelling and give it a unique angle with the mute protagonist on top of the lack of dialogue that could've made this movie so much more tense. Unfortunately, the lack of dialogue detracts from the characterization and feels forced in many scenes. I feel like there could've been a lot more done with the protagonist who's very well performed, but not well written. I question his willingness to go on shooting sprees when his son was killed by a stray bullet. There is nothing really done with the protagonist suddenly becoming mute, and the drama with his wife has no real development. The mandatory set up for the emotional beats to hit are executed in such a boring and cliche way and takes up what feels like half the film. Every scene with the son felt so repetitive, and like it was begging you to care with the music, but I really didn't. It almost became cheesy, especially at the end. There's this cop character that's just... there, I guess. There's no personality given to the villains except it keeps cutting to the main villain drugging and shagging this random girl...When we finally get to the action John Woo does deliver, but it's not his best work, and doesn't redeem such a thin story. There's moments of Woo's brilliance shining through what are mostly just pretty good action sequences by today's standards. A lot of the car scenes weren't the best either. The action has its moments and the visuals are often cool, but even then there are some odd directorial choices like overuse of slow-mo and some odd editing choices. I always just felt like there's this great action scene coming, and some parts were, but other parts were off. What's worse is that much of the action feels completely unbelievable and just dumb with the protagonist, of course, getting along through luck and pure incompetence from the villains. The last 2 confrontations in this movie are what really tanked it for me to call it bad. It's just plain ridiculous and unsatisfying how they unfold. Genuinely feels like some AI choreography, unreal, and it's so stupid character wise.With all this being said I still mostly enjoyed the movie thanks to some good action and visuals, but I felt like it was more due to the goodwill I have for John Woo, like I owe him for his older awesome films. This was overall a disappointing film and such a waste of the concept. I hope someone else tries something like this again and does better. I don't want to be too hard on Mr. Woo though. Please John Woo, you are better than this, and we still love you!(4/10)"

There's lots of things blowing up, lots of scowling, lots of blood everywhere, and my personal favorite: man get shot multiple times yet in the span of less than a year turns into a ripped bodybuilder with perfect athletic ability. But little talking, and not much background music other than what the characters are playing on their radios.I loved it even with its predictability only because of said lack of dialogue.

So, like Die Hard, it IS a Christmas movie-Ho, Ho, Ho. Joel plays a man that is playing in his front yard with his 7 year old son on Christmas Eve when his son is caught in the cross fire of 2 gangs shooting at each other. While Catalina, Joel's wife, cradles their dead son, Joel gives chase on foot and gets left for dead when he is shot several times-once in the throat-and looses his voice from the incident. Kid plays the policeman assigned the case and Harold is the gang leader that did the shooting. After Joel's release from the hospital, he grieves and then decides to get his revenge, one year later-he marks his calendar saying Kill them all on Christmas Eve. He spends the year by doing all the action star regiments; getting in physical shape, learning to shoot a gun and learning how to use a knife and of course, he learns how to drive a souped up car with reinforced armor plating. If you like John Woo movies, you should enjoy this one. If you think there is too much talking in action movies, you should really like this one, because there is not a single line of dialogue in the whole film. That's right, you have dialogue free violence.It's rated R for strong bloody violence, drug use and language-I know, you are wondering how there could be language with no dialogue. It's all by graffiti, text or radio transmissions-and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."

Build up to piecing together the plan holds Oceans like quality, but yet is simplistic and the visuals giving you that thousand word approach for efficiency.-And once the action starts, I can say it hits just about every box in terms of action, kills, carnage, and that justice driven shot that sums things up so well. All with stable camera work to give you the experience without the mess.The Action: -It's big, it's bold, it's bloody, and it's the promise of the trailers.-Silent Night has moments that again show how a good director makes those moments that make you say expletives or at least oh Wow.-Gun play, knife work, and some fisticuffs fly as the savagery of the movie unleashes into a fight that has edge, dynamics, and stakes that are exciting to see. Fun moves that blend modern day with video game style moves, a sort of gang busting cowboy at times.-Combined with that emotional cinematography, it helps elevate the fight past the usual bland punches that most action movies take when they aren't action.-Fantastic and the heart of the movie, Silent Night's third act is exactly the climactic experience you want to the buildup that this movie was designing. Loved it.-And even more impressive, is that unlike some action heroes, you take damage you keep it, only further adding that realistic measure to give a little more excitement to the film.-It misses few beats, and the character tale through the violence... works on some level that pulls it all together.DISLIKES:The Story Is Meh -There is emotion, and there is relevance, but that's about all this simplistic tale has to go for it.-Where John Wick accomplishes this to a better degree, Silent Night is more of a visual direction story to live through with little thought, which may work for those wanting adrenaline.-Yet the directions they chose in the beginning could have used a little more, some engaging characters, some discussions, something to help add that spark for inclusion.-Fortunately the action helps distract from this but still there was more that could have been done for me.The opening is a tad slow and repetitive: -You'll get the vision of grief, remorse, and trauma, but perhaps a tad too much for my liking.-Seeing these moments of mourning start out fine, but they get very lengthy, see it happen a lot for nearly one hour and at times get a tad creepy.-Again, it's a bold artistic statement, but this added a lot of bloating at the beginning, and could have been done a little less time manner to improve in my ability.-Or you know integrated in a manner that didn't get too odd or distracting.Character Integration: -It's really a story about the silent protagonist alone, and that works, but for the fact of integrating Kid Cudi into the mix and modeling him a key player -Silent Night kind of stinks in terms of building up most of the characters, suing only the attitude, the shots, and some simple story elements to make it work. You have little attachment to them, even the mom and that was a shame given the potential.-It could have used more planning and magic, but again, for most it won't be an issue when you are in the midst of gun play.The Violence: -Another warning than dislike, the violence is again to the level where sensitive beings need to stay away.-It's gory and realistic, gun shots and knife wounds deep and close up to unleash the true injury that comes with it.-Sure, there is excitement, but its vicious, paints the walls with red saturation, and can be very disturbing if you aren't prepared.-A tad excessive? Yeah, near the end especially, but still within reason for most members going to see this film.THE VERDICT: -Silent Night is pretty much a unique twist on a Christmas action film, that holds Woo's style with cinema making and the typical adrenaline fuel of the genre. A pace that is quick, this movie uses the bare minimum to tell the story and get into the motivational montages of fighting and training to get you into the film. It's simplicity is both genius and limiting, but for the most part this action film is ready to unleash madness with strong visuals, great choreography, and a realistic edge that helps keeps things engaging. Such fight scenes prove the right directors can still make good pieces in terms of action stunts, fighting, and the splendor that they can be. However, the movie lacks a fleshed out story, it lacks character usage, and is really just a spectacle of violence that though fulfilling is not the most engaging piece to come to mind. I had fun with it, but there are still better pieces that balance both story and the flair of action. It certainly delivers on the element of the trailers, but again caution to those sensitive to violence and trauma being repeated a tad too much. Thus, my scores are:Action: 7.5-8.0 Movie overall: 6.0."

The problem is, however, that his imagery is not strong enough to hold my attention for as long as the film demanded, and the film's plot was also paper thin.A lot of scenes come off as awkward, and unnatural because the characters should be talking, but for some inexplicable reason are not. I was starting to wonder if I had missed a scene where everybody gets shot in the neck, and not just the main character? It was ridiculous! Even when the wife is grieving with him and he goes all insane, throwing things and raging, she just stares at him and says nothing. Same with Kid Cudi's character. A lot of his screentime is just him staring at some photos or into a room without saying anything. Made the film almost unbearable to watch.The plot itself was ripped right out of Death Sentence, which was also a ripoff of Death Wish. I'm thinking Hollywood needs either better ideas, or better filmmakers. I don't mind a reused idea, but reuse it with purpose, to expand or better the previous product. Neither happened here.I also want to touch on how cheap the film looked. I'm not sure what the budget was, but surely they could have done better than this. The vast majority of the film is shot frenetically, so it's hard to see the action most of the time. It's also shot in some pretty low light, also making it difficult to see anything. The cinematography is what should draw people into this movie, considering that it probably didn't even have a script, and they couldn't even pull that off.Overall, this film is a mess and a shame. Such a simple premise and you make one of the most boring and irritating action films I think I've ever seen. I'm going to rewatch Face/Off to make me forget this film ever happened.0.5 shots in the neck out of 5."

I am not someone who expects movies to be realistic. Because lets face it, if that were true, I would never see 99% of the movies that have been made. My mom will tell you i usually like bad movies. But i still feel that main plot points of a movie need to make some sense. And I just found too many things in this movie that didn't.First, I will start off with the fact that these career gang members have the accuracy of a two-year-old with a Nerf gun. In the beginning of the film, there is a scene, that you can see in the trailer, that involves two rival gangs driving in cars and shooting at each other. Despite the fact that these cars are within 2 feet of each other and all of these big bad guys have automatic weapons, neither side hits each other for miles. Then, in the last act of the movie that is the big shootout in the building, again that you can see in the movie's trailer, these lifetime criminals run up on the guy and don't get a bullet off before this homebody dad shoots them? You have got to be kidding me! Harry Potter had better accuracy in \"Guns Akimbo\".My other problem is with the main character himself. The movie plays up how he spends nine months preparing to exact revenge and kill all the gang members with fight training from youtube, target practice and working out. Yet the first fight he gets in he gets his ass kicked horribly. If I were him, I would get all the money back I paid for the gun club because the training did absolutely nothing. The only reason he can kill any of them is because the gang members have the accuracy of a magic eight ball. Joel is a scrawny dad and yet this tough gang can't kill him? He's not John Wick. And the only thing that has been on his mind all this time is revenge. How come whenever he killed somebody he looked upset about it?Lastly, while I do get that emotion plays a big part in this movie because there is no dialogue, those scenes were repetitive and very long. Half of them were unnecessary and just a drag.The plot line to this movie is not unique at all. In fact, it was like a Tubi version of Death Wish, The Punisher, Death Sentence, etc.. That combined with the ridiculous so-called gang members is why I dislike and was very disappointed in this film."

The action sequences delivers. The gun shoot out scenes are thrilling. And best with his style. Joel Kinnaman delivers with his performance. The film also has barely any dialogue to none at all. Which still works. Weird in some scenes as other characters do not speak. Understand with Joel Kinnaman as he gets shot at his throat which he cant speak at all. The action delivers. The music score is good that works with the tone and direction. May not be Woos best film but it is a good comeback."

However the way they are done in 'Dream Scenario' was perfect. This film was a blast.Talk about getting everything out of a concept. The movie starts and you think, okay this is a lot of fun, but where are they going to go from here? Have no fear, they have plenty of tricks up their sleeves and the wild ride continues throughout.The film is hilarious. It contained some of the biggest theatre laughs I've heard in a long time. But it's more than that too. It actually gets quite touching and sad and has some real thought-provoking stuff going on. This was an excellent film. 8/10."

Similar to Adaptation or The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent ,Cage plays a man who needs everyone to know how smart he is in a way that makes him unlikeable slightly, which makes it interesting when life happens to him and the world starts to intergrade him into their dreams for no known reason and it takes an unfair turn that gives a vivid reflection on culture and social media if you ask me.It was an eye opener that made me laugh out loud because the metaphor on social commentary was just so dead on.Greatest Nicolas Cage movie of the year and Reinfeld came out this same year (along with a lot of other Nicolas Cage movies actually)"

                "content": "Dream Scenario is a really funny look at unexpected fame and how it's impossible to control how others interpret it. A be careful what you wish for story that's a lot stronger when primarily focusing on how fame changes a person than when it delves into cancel culture.Uncomfortable with how his own image has been interpreted, Nicolas Cage is the ideal person for this. He plays the pitiful nature of Paul beautifully and brings none of the Cage rage he's synonymous with, in a nice change of pace. The film also feels aware of Cage's persona, understanding everything is funnier and weirder because it's Nic Cage specifically.Kristoffer Borgli's direction really nails the dream sequences in particular. They're very surreal (obviously), brief and when they start to turn into nightmares they really don't hold back on the violence. It also has the second most hilariously awkward sex scene of recent memory, with Beau Is Afraid being number one which is so fitting since Ari Aster is a producer on this."

                "content": "Dream Scenario. The increasingly brilliant Nicholas Cage continues his renaissance following his recent superb performances in Mandy, Pig and The unbearable weight of massive talent. Cage plays a run of the mill university professor who oozes normality. His students take no real notice of him. His former colleagues publish papers in top journals whilst he hasn't even started his book yet. But he's happy enough, if not fulfilled. Then, for no apparent reason, he starts appearing in people's dreams. Not just people who know or have met him. Anyone. And in the dreams they tend to be in difficult positions but he does absolutely nothing. He has no control over this. The first half of the film is hilarious - the whole cinema (the lovely Electric, Birmingham) we're in stitches as we see the dreams played out. And then the second half of the film takes a sinister turn, to reflect a changing nature of the dreams. And whilst the comedy ends at this point, the drama begins. Whilst the first half is the better half it would be wrong to say the second is disappointing. Cage is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors. Long may it continue. 8 out of ten."

                "content": "So, having heard nothing about this film, never mind seeing a trailer or preview for it, I went into this one blind with only the synopsis to go by.The film stars Nicolas Cage as a hapless family man who finds his life turned upside down when millions of strangers suddenly start seeing him in their dreams. When his nighttime appearances take a nightmarish & sinister turn, Paul is forced to navigate his newfound stardom.I found the film to be bizarre. I'm still right now trying to process what I watched. It was pretty engaging despite being dragged out in places & kept you wanting to know more & why the main lead was being dreamed about & of course, why the dreams about him turn sinister & violent.The film's story & concept is definitely unique & did remind me (& is funnily enough parodied here) like A Nightmare On Elm Street. The horror aspects (what little there was) were good & there's some awkward, yet funny & humourous scenes to be had.What annoyed me about the film was the lack of explanation as to why people were dreaming about Paul Matthews & of course why the dreams turned sour.Moreover, the unlike-ability of the characters in the film, the family members, the students, his friends & others treating him like he was a criminal. Couldn't these people in the film tell the difference between fantasy & reality? Were they that gullible & dumb to not know the difference? The way he was treated in the film really made me feel sorry for the guy. It was both annoying & hard to watch to be honest. Not to mention they way they blamed him for something that was completely out of his control. Unbelievable.The film itself was pretty depressing in a lot of areas & towards the end we didn't get any reconciliation of the characters that treated him badly & continued to blame him for the nightmares they were having. The film did have a decent runtime of 1 hour & 36 minutes (96 minutes) & not bad pacing despite being sluggish in areas.Overall, it's a mixed bag this one. There's some good points & bad. It's an out there type of film which is neither good or bad, but ok & bizarre. Judge for yourself when you come to see it.6/10."

A timid professor who has awkward experiences almost daily gets to steal the limelight when he starts to appear as an impassive spectator in other people's dreams. He enjoys the fame, which seems to flutter his immediate family. And so starts a ride to uncharted territory, speaking a lot about the current state of affairs around us. Cancel culture, 'gram influencers, AI, mind implanting - everything gets a nod in this superbly structured film that I could relate with so much. Nicolas Cage is so good as the central character, almost making me feel that he was enacting me on onscreen. The right amount of awkwardness, perfect look and air, and an honest outlook. This is the best film I watched at the 2023 MAMI Mumbai Film Festival so far."

The slow destruction of the life of an ordinary man for reasons which were completely outside his control was well-conceived, well-plotted and well acted. Nicholas Cage's performance was pitch perfect.To an extent, this film can be seen as a satirical condemnation of social media fame and cancel culture, though that's secondary to the theme of mounting paranoia - both from Prof Matthews and the wider world.The fact that this film started out as a project of Ari Aster is no surprise, as it has much in common with Beau is Afraid - notably the hapless and powerless central character and some surreal and blackly comic moments.Then, in the last fifteen minutes or so, the film loses its way. A new element is brought in which pretty much undermines what had gone before. The result wasn't bad, exactly, but seemed to belong in a different film. I think it would've been better if the film had had the courage of its convictions and followed Prof Matthews to his logical fate.For all that, it's an interesting film, and I would urge you to see it."

His wife Janet (Julianne Nicholson) loves him and appreciates him, but sometimes appears to be an enabler to his own neurosis. When one day people start to tell him that he appears in their dream. Complete strangers.This conceit is a remarkable absurd moment that rockets him into a roller coaster of fame, acceptance and eventual downfall.If you were to put this in context of society, you could say the social media influencers who go viral and inevitably create haters. These are the most dangerous people.At times, it's frustrating to deal with Paul. Since he constantly pitches a book he never intends to write. To a lot of \"creators\" this is painful to watch. A person so devoid of ambition he requires others to antagonize him into action. He relies on victimhood in a sense. And hasn't concluded how unfair life is.This miraculous event shoots him into a world he is unfamiliar with. Where people now \"see\" him. Which he believes will give him the validation he craves. But it backfires when he doesn't do all the right things (the things we would do with this level of fame).The failure of this film is that it does require him to constantly be a punching bag. While a person with common sense would bend to the masses for a specific reason, Paul tends to do the opposite because the plot wants it to happen. This needs to happen for the story to spiral on him. There is no reason for his stubborn behavior. But this could just be a behavioral thing we are suppose to see as a character flaw. To the viewer, it could be REALLY frustrating.The tone of the film is very much like \"Eternal Sunshine Of A Spotless Mind\" Not necessarily the story, but the tone. It is quirky and sometimes laugh out loud funny. Thought I'd never say that. His adventures are silly but fascinating. A smarter socially wiser man would slingshot the fame into something more. Many people who struggle in life would take the Sprite endorsement.In the end, it happens regardless of his efforts. Or lack of.The last part of the movie is a bit rushed. It has very little to do with him and more to do with us as a society. We take a bizarre event and monetize it. We fall for the stupidity of technology. And so forth. It taps into the delusion of getting rich through attention seeking. That part falls a little short. In a longer film, perhaps this would be integrated smoother.This is, in my opinion, Nic Cage's best role. I go back into his filmography and haven't seen anything that required him this level of heavy lifting. It's impressive that he embodies Paul without having his normal wild Cage-ism which I am grateful for. His career is very eclectic but somehow this film fits him like a well tailored suit.A must watch of 2023."

This all happens in this movie, with Cage as the driving force.Cage totally look unrecognisable as the professor, bald head, gruff beard, funny walk, he really goes for it. And has too. Everyone else is collateral damage and the enemy. It's a cleaver film on what is going on in the world and media right now, spun into this strange world, which I would not want to a part off, but we are, like it or not.Mixed bag on this one, it's good, but will divide everyone, and people will see things differently, which is the point."

This is a very traditional \"Nicolas Cage\" drama, through and through. It has an air of humor and awkwardness throughout all of it due to his performance, but overall, there's a bigger picture behind it. Oddly enough, in a lot of ways it felt like a very late companion piece to Cage's performance in The Weather Man, a movie where his character also deals with consequences of fame while dealing with a crumbling family life. The biggest difference is that Dream Scenario leans farther into the consequences of fame that celebrities never asked for and that consumers fail to understand because of the media. This is a very sad and upsetting movie that I would say accurately captures that feeling of not having control of your life. It's definitely among the best films I've seen this year."

                "content": "I must say first that Dream Scenario is not at all what I expected it to be. After falling in love with writer/director Kristoffer Borgli's previous film Sick Of Myself, then exploring all of his recent short films on YouTube, I thought I had a grasp on what to expect from Dream Scenario, but I was off and that makes it a bit more challenging to form a solid opinion on. One thing is for certain though: regardless of how much you feel like you are enjoying the film as you are watching it, this is the kind of movie that will have you thinking and talking about it, trying to find all the analogies, for some time afterwards. Though my girlfriend left the theater a total of 4 times due to anxiety, she pulled even more apt metaphor out of it than I did when it was over - it gave us a lot to discuss, far more than the average movie.The overall tone was way different than I was expecting. The trailer had me thinking this would be a quirky adventure into dreams and personalities, but Dream Scenario is FAR more horror-leaning than I'd imagined. Having seen Borgli's previous work in combination with the choice to have Nicolas Cage as the lead, this really threw me off. Once you get into it, it often feels like the work of Ari Aster, which made a lot more sense to me when the ending credits hit and I saw that Ari Aster had produced it. Apparently Aster was originally set to direct this film with Adam Sandler as the lead, but after Sick Of Myself did well, Aster pushed to get Borgli in the director's chair for A24. Overall, the movie has its signature Borgli moments but it definitely feels like a combination of Borgli, Aster, and A24 vibes rather than simply a Borgli piece.There is not nearly as much comedy as I thought there would be, and most of it is very subdued. I felt like I was laughing more than anyone else in the theater, and it was not much, to be honest. Laughs are simply not one of the primary focuses of the film, in my opinion. And on the subject of atypical focuses, there are hardly fleshed-out characters in this movie at all - they are more like archetypes or vessels that allow the themes to be explored. The way Cage's character works is that he is an effective \"every man\" in the sense that he's not really likable, but also not especially unlikable - he could be just about any average person, and that's the point. The real \"main character\" is society and their response to what's happening in a collective manner.While it's not the most riveting or throughly enjoyable film, it is incredibly original and does seem to have a lot to say underneath it's surface of \"simplicity\". I was expecting something in the realm of Charlie Kaufman, but what I got was perhaps something I can't compare to almost anything else. At one point in the film, there is a book that is released, and when it does the character who wrote it exclaims \"It was supposed to be called Dream Scenario\", then the publisher responds, \"Is there something wrong with the new title, I Am Your Nightmare?\". I feel like this is a fitting summary of my entire experience with this film. I'm not sure if that was all set up on purpose, as a \"haha\" at the viewer's expense, but knowing Borgli and his specific style of genius-level trolling, I'd say he knew exactly what he was doing."

                "content": "It has been a while since I went to the theatre and had such a great time. Dream Scenario is one of Studio A24's latest theatrical releases and it may just be their cleverest, smartest, and hilarious film of the year. The ads for this film intrigued me, but I did t expect the level of filmmaking craft put into such a whacky concept. It won't be for everyone, like many A24 films are, but if you're a film lover, I think you may love this one as I did. So let's dive into this bizarre film.Paul Matthew (Nicolas Cage) is a boring family man who wants nothing more in life than to have his book published. Out of nowhere, he begins to appear in the dreams of strangers. In these dreams, he does nothing but stands there and observe. This eventually turns into thousands, if not millions of people dreaming about him. This very quickly gives him fame, but when dreams become nightmares, it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Paul. The film's final act also deals with a lot of social commentary on our real world and virtual world in a very clever way. With the actual serious plot at hand aside, let's dive into why I had so much fun as well.Having liked Nicolas Cage as an actor for my whole life, I'll admit he has made many questionable acting choices and taken some very questionable roles over the last decade or two. He's much more out there these days, but I still always love it when he releases a new film. Well, this might be his best performance in many, many years. He brought the emotional weight of the character to the screen when the film required him to do so, but I'm also not sure if I've ever laughed this hard at a single performance in quite some time. From a scene involving a fart to his perfect line deliveries, I was laughing from start to finish. This film is entirely on his shoulders and he just ran with it. I don't think he knew he was making such an overall great film though.The visual depictions of each of the dreams in this film are all very creative and what they mean/turn into later was, quite frankly, genius. Director Kristoffer Borgli seems to have only worked mostly on short films, but this film alone will have me glancing at his small catalogue and awaiting his next big project because he has a promising future. He also wrote this film, which is why I have so much hope for him. He took an incredible concept and took it past the finish line and the final product is glorious. It was his vision and his vision completely worked for me.To wrap things up, this is an incredibly made film all around, especially taking into account that it was made for a very small budget. I will admit that the only reason I'm not saying it's nearly perfect or giving it a perfect score is for the way it concludes. The final act worked for me and blended well with the rest of the film, but I found the very final scene to be quite abrupt. Everything comes to a conclusion but I felt a scene or two more could've made the ending land slightly better for me. I can't quite put my finger on it because the entire film is superb, so I'll simply say I'm selfish and wanted a little more. Dream Scenario is now playing in theatres. It's weird and I absolutely recommend it."

I presume is an analagy to how 'the woke' arbitarily cancel others with a nod to hypocrisy at the end where ideas are then embraced.Other than that, I'm not really sure what this film is about and in the last 15 minutes are so I was hoping it would end soon.Would I watch it again ?

Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) is a milquetoast biology prof who has always dreamed about writing a book about ants, though he hasn't started writing it yet. He's married to Janet (Julianne Nicholson); they have two daughters, Sophie (Lily Bird) and Hannah (Jessica Clement). Brett (Tim Meadows) is the dean at the university; Richard (Dylan Baker) is a colleague who is much more outgoing and popular.The movie, somewhat in the spirit of \"Twilight Zone,\" suddenly has both acquaintances and strangers to Paul having frequent dreams about Paul. Initially, he is simply a bystander to dramatic events in the dreams, but gradually, the dreams change in a more sinister direction. The movie follows changes in people's reactions to Paul and the impact of these changes on Paul and his marriage. Events spiral until, finally, entrepreneurship takes over with its own effect on Paul.\"Dream Scenario\" is a clever idea, and it especially works in college towns where we've all known professors with some of Paul's characteristics. Nicolas Cage is both funny and edgy, and Julianne Nicholson does well as his wife, who is supportive to a certain level. The script could have gone deeper with the children and Paul's university colleagues. There is good humor in Paul's erstwhile relationship with a PR firm headed by Trent (Michael Cera), and especially his assistant, Molly (Dylan Gelula).It's entertaining but not great."

He only really chews up the scenery in the dreams and once in real life when students vandallse his car. Interesting the way his appearances in dreams move on from him being just an observer of people in violent/threatening scenarios to the poinr where the film pivots into horror and he attacks, strangles, stabs people in what have now become nightmares. He goes from having disinterested students in his class to being their favourite professor but then gets effectively cancelled by them. Their dreams/nightmares become their lived experience. An interesting critique of cancel culture infuses the film, sometimes explicit but also implicit in other scenes. A Hipster PR firm firm is also used to satirise the industry, they want him to advertise Sprite and get into Obama's dreams. As he turns from hero to zero they want to push him at the Jordan Petersen demographic. Paul Matthews is basically a frumpy middle aged male, always in an anorak, he has to be asked to take it off when he;s being seduced. He holds grudges and perhaps unfairly, even irrationally believes that an old grad school colleague has stolen his ideas. An interesting observation of the male midlife crisis taken to a Fortean level. See this film! Written and Directed by Kristoffer Borgli. 8.5/10."

It's advertised as a comedy, but there aren't really many laughs, and I wouldn't even call it a black comedy. As we watch Paul Matthews' (Nicolas Cage) life slowly disassemble through no fault of his own, it wanders fully into the horror regime. Not some crude slasher type of thing -- stylisically this is closer to what Alfred Hitchcock might have made with the same material. And personally I just don't react well to horror -- there are twenty different things I'd rather do with my time, thanks. If I hadn't been with friends, I might not have sat through it all.Not that it's a bad production. On the contrary, it's well acted (and thus effective) and Nic Cage displays all his considerable acting skills to the full. Matthews is a sort of dumpy middle-aged professor at some small college who's a failed researcher and a rather ordinary teacher. Everything about him is ordinary. He's not dislikable but not terribly interesting or likable either, and is just generally ineffectual at everything at either work or home. He's not someone you would want to spend a lot of time with. (Paradoxically, Cage is so good at conveytng Paul's lackluster life and inner nature that he actually makes us less interested to watch!) Paul likes the momentary fame of being at the center of this unique communal dream phenomenon, but when it takes a violent turn (in the dreams, that is) he doesn't seem to know what to do, gives in to his buried rage, and ends up participating in his own destruction.There's lots of satire of modern life, like cancel culture, New Age woo-woo thinking, the emptiness of suburbia, monetization and corporatization of practically anything, and me-first attitudes -- but I felt like these were secondary to the main thread of horror/tragedy. Sorry, but not for me. The thing is that if some explanation had been given for why this communal-dream phenomenon was happening, and thus what to do about it, it would have been more in the direction of a science-fiction movie. I might have found that more interesting. When word gets around that this obscure person is appearing in all kinds of peoples' dreams, researchers would jump on it and treat it as a huge puzzle to be solved -- something that would reveal much about the brain and collective unconscious and so forth. There's no sign that any of that is happening here, it's all focussed on the reactive effects on Paul and his life. In the end I'm not sure what to take away from this thing."

It asks some interesting questions about celebrity & \"cancel culture.\" It did occur to me afterwards that the movie is completely ridiculous and posits a scenario that is beyond impossible, and thus, spending a lot of time talking about its implications seems a bit silly. But, I err on the side of it being a worthwhile intellectual exercise. To say nothing of being a terrific showcase for Nicolas Cage.Cage is Paul Matthews, an aging, balding (and apparently always cold because he wears gigantic, ill-fitting coats throughout the film) tenured professor at a modest college. His students pay little attention to him (even though, to be honest, it seems like he's a more interesting professor than many I experienced myself). He leads a frustrating professional life. Early in the film, he has lunch with an very distant colleague who is preparing to publish a paper that touches on subjects that Matthews worked on decades ago. He feels these topics still somehow belong to him, and wants some credit for the paper. He mentions that he's working on a book on the topic...but it turns out he hasn't actually started writing the thing. It's an idea he has and apparently has had for many years. He's a guy who imagines doing great or interesting things, but it will never happen for him. We meet his loving wife (Julianne Nicholson, always under-rated) and his doting daughters. From the viewer's perspective, he's a bit of schlub. An uninspiring instructor, eaten up by his own failures, and sadly unable to see that his great family really means he's got it pretty darn good. Nice house. Nice kids. Nice wife.But he's a bit clueless. And when he suddenly starts appearing in the dreams of millions of people around the world, he becomes a clueless celebrity (or at least, cultural phenomena). His classroom is full of people who want a selfie with him. He's on the news. He's written about. He's beloved. And he's done nothing to deserve the positive accolades. For some strange reason, he is a background character in the dreams of millions of strangers. He just hovers there, really doing nothing. But just the fact that he's at the center of this weird thing makes him popular. And when talent agents come calling, he sees his opportunity to get a book deal.But then, things go abruptly wrong, and he goes from saint to demon overnight. None of it is his fault, but he's suddenly a pariah. And he handles it very, very badly...putting at risk everything good in his life.It's all so unfair. Paul did NOTHING to make these dreams happen. The \"character\" he is in the dreams bears no resemblance to his true persona. He is right to rail against his vilification. Yet his own unpleasant character traits tee us up to NOT sympathize with him. Does he have it coming? Did his own flaws somehow taint his benign dream persona? Why doesn't the public understand that the dream Paul and the real Paul have nothing to do with each other?It's all very interesting, and Cage makes it all matter thanks to the best performance he's given in some time. With this movie and the excellent, over-looked PIG...Cage demonstrates his true acting chops. Yes, he's delightful in THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF MASSIVE TALENT, but even in well-received films like THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE, his performances are over-the-top and even unhinged.Enjoyable...absolutely. But fine acting? No. He's always a bit broad in his performances, but DREAM SCENARIO harnesses his energy and spins Paul Matthews into a complex character we can understand and feel things about. The script is tight and energetic and clever and funny. The supporting cast (again, special kudos to Nicholson) is on the right wavelength. And the questions the film asks are very relevant in our time of social media, overnight sensations and overnight demonizations. It's a fun film on the surface, very much worth it for Cage's well-done work...but it also rewards some reflection and discussion. I heartily recommend it."

                "content": "Packing a lot of material and ideas into a single film can result in a muddled, confusing mess, no matter how well-meaning a filmmaker's intentions might be. However, in his third feature outing, writer-director Kristoffer Borgli succeeds for the most part when it comes to tackling such an imposing task. This offbeat tale of tenured but underappreciated university professor (Nicolas Cage) takes viewers on a wild ride through the diverse realms of fame, metaphysics, cancel culture, unrelenting group think, and unexpressed, underpursued desire, and the downside consequences of each. All of this comes about when the middle-aged everyman protagonist inexplicably begins showing up in the dreams of countless people, many of whom he doesn't even know. This curious oneiric anomaly - an inspired metaphor for one's presence on social media and in the public eye - quickly transforms him into an overnight viral media sensation, one that starts off with a generous showering of attention and lustful admiration but that almost as quickly leads him to become a scorned put-upon pariah. He swiftly becomes more than just yesterday's news; he turns into the object of a targeted campaign of cancel culture, hate speech and unapologetic ostracism. And, ironically, it all stems from something he never wanted nor asked for in the first place (at least in the form it ultimately took). From the foregoing description, it might sound like the filmmaker has tried to overstuff this vehicle with far too much material for viewers to process and comprehend, and there are points in the story (especially in the last half hour) where a good case could be made for that argument. However, in telling this allegorical fable, the director manages to keep the narrative's ideas distinctly sorted and in context to drive home his message, a powerful cautionary tale about the point we've collectively reached as a society with respect to these powerful and potentially damaging matters and practices. These are notions that we all need to hear but seldom do because of all the noise surrounding us that prevents us from hearing the music because of all the notes. For all this seriousness, however, \"Dream Scenario\" is loaded with hilarious, laugh-out-loud humor and fine performances all around (especially Cage and Michael Cera as an empty-headed, self-absorbed brand management expert), complemented with skillful film editing and carefully selected incidental shots that effectively punctuate the mood of many scenes. The script is generally solid, too, though it begins to stray somewhat from the material that works best in the final act, and there are a few graphically violent sequences that sensitive viewers should be wary of. On balance, though, this is the kind of production that should be made in greater numbers in an age where so many of us have lost touch with reason, our existence and ourselves. Maybe watching an offering like this could help us all sit up, think and get back on track while we still can."

What's going on here?The hilarious start of this movie is to die for. It made me curious as heck! After a wonderfully joyful start it veers into darker territory though!In short (and without revealing spoilers) this movie cleverly and symbolically dances around (a very actual) theme of being preyed upon, when one stands out alone from the crowd. It's a character portrait and an allegory firstmost, \"disguised\" as a quirky comedy.I wont start saying (again) that Nicholas Cage is back, because this truly brilliant actor has been on a lucky streak of several actor's gems in a row for some years now! And this is another one of his very best acting performances!Highly recommended for the art house movie fans of quirky comedies with a deeper symbolic meaning. Memories of the best of Charlie Kaufman's work (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) come to mind when watching this wonderful trip of a story.I APPLAUD the writer AND director Kristoffer Borgli for writing this marvellous allegory, brilliantly directed, with every techinical detail (photography, editing, sound) being simply superb.What a trip. What a joy. So dreamlike, yet real and heartfelt! Bravo! I wish upon you a similar wonderful experience as I have had watching \"Dream Scenario\".Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."

                "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. David Bowie's 1975 song \"Fame\" has a line, \"Fame ... what you get is no tomorrow\", and that stuck with me during the second half of this terrific and wild film from Norwegian writer-director Kristoffer Borgli (SICK OF MYSELF, 2022). Borgli not only tackles the issue of sudden fame and the weight that goes with it, but he also comments on ego and today's cancel culture. Subtext runs throughout a film that feels descended from the mind of Charlie Kaufman and/or Spike Jonze.Oscar winner Nicolas Cage is perfectly cast as Paul Matthews, a bland Evolutionary Biology professor, living a satisfactory life with his wife Janet (the always strong Julianne Nicholson) and their two daughters Sophie (Lily Bird) and Hannah (Jessica Clement). As for his career, Paul, always dressed in a sweater and green jacket, is frumpy and awkward and an undistinguished faculty member who speaks frequently of writing a book, though he never actually writes anything.Things change quickly for Paul as he begins showing up in people's dreams. As in his life, Dream-Paul doesn't do much other than 'be there', but as the number of people who experience this grows exponentially, Paul becomes a celebrity ... leading to the publicity machine we've witnessed many times in real life. Basically, Paul goes viral. Cage masters the delivery of this line: \"Have you been dreaming about me?\", and it's the point where we recognize he is delivering an outstanding performance. When do-nothing dream-Paul turns aggressive and violent in folk's dreams (now nightmares), his experience shifts dramatically. Cancel culture kicks in and Paul becomes an outcast or pariah. Filmmaker Borgli could draw from numerous real-life situations where teachers have been dismissed for absurd reasons ... OK, maybe not as absurd as actions in a dream, yet the concept is the same.Borgli was surely inspired by Spike Jonze's excellent ADAPTATION (2002), which featured Nic Cage in a dual role (as Kaufman and his fictional brother). Although this isn't technically a dual role, Cage certainly gets to carve a wide swath through the film and through dreams ... and he appears to be having a great time doing so. Supporting work is provided by Dylan Baker, Tim Meadows, Dylan Gelula, and Kate Berlant. Michael Cera has a humorous sequence as a PR agent at a marketing firm that is trying to cash in on Paul's newfound fame as a \"dream influencer\". We even see capitalism at work in a further attempt to create an industry out of this flukey situation.The brilliance of the film stems from Borgli presenting this as an entertaining comedy-horror film with 'everyman' Paul at the center. It's a clever idea that is not-so-subtle in its willingness to show us how easily cancel culture can spin out of control and how monetizing our addiction to attention can go wrong. One specific thing that I admired in Borgli's approach was how he made Paul a normal guy, and yet, he's one of those who always believes someone has wronged him or stolen his work - despite the fact that he never actually produces any work or takes his own risk. There is so much to like about this film, not the least of which is one of Nicolas Cage's best ever performances (even in David Byrne's oversized suit).Opens in theaters on December 1, 2023."

Unfortunately, Dream Scenario is a classic case of most of the good bits being in the trailer.Once the film has established its quirky set-up -- college professor Paul Matthews becomes a sensation when he randomly starts to appear in strangers' dreams and is courted by a marketing agency keen to exploit his 'exposure'-- it doesn't really go anywhere interesting, its commentary on the potential pitfalls of fame, in particular the scourge of cancel culture, topical but not exactly profound.Cage is as loopy as always, and undeniably fun to watch, as his character initially enjoys his newfound celebrity, but has to deal with fear and mistrust when his night-time appearances take a darker turn; but his latest off-beat performance in a career littered with such roles can only take us so far, and the plot loses traction in the final act as it introduces a sci-fi element, borne out of Paul Matthews' inexplicable experience: a device that enables anyone to enter another person's dreams."

                "content": "\"I wish this was real.\"A dark story that walks along an edge between comedy and Kafkaesque nightmare, Dream Scenario tells the tale of a hapless middle-aged professor (Nicolas Cage) who suddenly achieves fame through the most unlikely of ways, by appearing in the dreams of a massive number of people. I love how creative the concept was, and that Cage took this role. He's fantastic, not over-emoting, not putting on some strange accent, just playing this frustrated, awkward guy to a tee. There are lots of funny moments, maybe none better than when he finds himself in the apartment of a woman young enough to be his daughter and she's coming on to him.Michael Cera is also brilliant as the leader of a trio at a company called Thoughts? Who seek to monetize the professor's notoriety, in conflict with his wishes to get an academic book published (one which, tellingly, he hasn't even started writing). In an interesting twist, when the professor's mood turns to frustration borne out of humiliation, his appearance in other people's dreams turns to violent nightmares. I kind of thought there might be a \"third act\" relative to what people dreamed about, but maybe its absence was an aspect of the film's originality, and how hard it is to pin down.Instead, the film begins to riff on cancel culture, as the professor finds himself going from acclaim to being a pariah, and because of things completely out of his control. He's like the zebra he's talked about in his lectures, sticking its neck out from the herd and getting noticed by predators. He vents his frustration about the over-use of the word \"trauma\" by the younger generation, and how social media, a milieu he's not very familiar with, is now destroying him. He's not the most sympathetic figure in the world, but how powerless and crushingly average he is makes him feel like a representative of one form or another. Along the way, there is also an amusing bit on those who seek to harness whatever power the professor had (which is never explained) to advertise or become dream influencers.Overall, it's a little depressing and doesn't hit a homerun or anything, but I found it inventive and engaging throughout."

                "content": "Charlie Swift (Pierce Brosnan) is a former Marine turned fixer for the crime syndicate in Biloxi, Mississippi that holds together even in the face of its aging head Stan Mullen's (James Caan) diminishing mental faculties. Following a hit on a low level crook named Rollo on behalf of New Orleans crime boss Beggar (Gbenga Akinnagbe), Beggar soon stages an attack that leaves most of the Biloxi crew dead. Charlie teams up with Rollo's ex Marcie (Morenca Baccarin) to find some evidence on Beggar he'd stashed away in order to take down Beggar and avenge his crew.Fast Charlie is an adaptation of the 2001 crime novel Gun Monkeys by Victor Gischler. Attempts had been made as far back as 2009 to adapt the novel to film when director Ryuhei Kitamura was slated to direct from a script by Lee Goldberg, but fell into development hell until producer Dan Grodnik acquired the project and resurrected it as a directing vehicle for Phillip Noyce with Richard Wenk of the Denzel Washington Equalizer films writing the script. Now unceremoniously released to on-demand, one would be forgiven for thinking this was throwaway action fodder built around a name cast. While Fast Charlie does hit upon many of the touchstones of the hitman adjacent action genre, it has a solid against type performance from Brosnan and a setting that distinguishes it from the more typical urban settings of this type of film.While I had reservations about Pierce Brosnan playing a southern Fixer for the Biloxi mafia, he does a pretty good job of taking on the accent and for the most part I was able to buy Brosnan as a hard edged aging fixer for a low level criminal enterprise. Despite now being in his 70s Brosnan still exudes strong charisma and charm and handles himself well enough in the action beats that Phillip Noyce knows how to stage. While the movie does include romantic subtext between Morena Baccarin's Marcie and Brosnan's Charlie (complete with a noticeable if not overtly objectionable age gap) at least Marcie is able to hold her own as a reasonably compelling character. James Caan is decent as the aging mob boss Stan Mullen in his final role, but as the character is in the waning years of his life Caan doesn't really get to do much except act confused and the fact he seems like he's still central to the Biloxi mafia's operations is never really addressed in how this is all working and is nebulously defined at best.This really goes into the biggest weakness of Fast Charlie in that it feels like its noir story isn't fully developed and squanders its unique setting for a conventional revenge narrative. While the movie's perfectly serviceable on that front, the movie's opening with its quirky characterization of a man named \"Blade\" who beheads a guy with a blasting cap loaded donut or the need to Identify an assassination target via a tattoo on his posterior feel like remnants from a quirkier more darkly comic material that Noyce and Wenk have decided to play more straight. I'll admit I don't know a lot about Victor Gischler, but from what I've seen it looks like he's known for adding humor to his crime stories and given Noyce is more known for straight action/thrillers with no comedy to his name I really have to wonder if Wenk and Noyce were the right team to tackle this material.As a performance piece for Pierce Brosnan, his central performance as Charlie Swift makes the movie worth a one time viewing in my opinion (when it hits whatever streaming service you happen to already be a member of) and it has more ambition and personality than your average VOD action thriller of this type. With that said there's moments where the original quirkiness and absurdity of the original premise shine through and they feel somewhat at odds with the direction Noyce and Wenk wanted to take this material and story elements such as how the Biloxi mafia continues to operate with its head's declining faculties feel underdeveloped and could've served as a movie unto themselves. A decent enough time killer that feels like it could've been much more."

Sort of like, if Bond retired and became a fixer, just for the giggles and some extra spending money. Gbenga is one of those others and he asks Pierce to fix a situation for him. Pierce takes an accomplice-one of Gbenga's men-with him and the job goes badly, so Gbenga starts killing people. His men bungle the job on Pierce so Pierce finds Morena, an ex girlfriend of the botched job, and soon, everybody is trying to kill everybody else while Pierce is just trying to survive. There are several nods to Pierce's Bond role. In one scene, Pierce stands in front of a locker with the number 7 on it. In another, Pierce is looking in his emergency stash box for a weapon and some money and a Walther PPK is seen in the box.

Lukewarm action film with handful exciting moments, nothing more than a tea-time film you play because you couldn't find anything better, even the inside-car scenes felt like they were shot in a studio rather than in an actual moving car (character outline was easy to notice for me at least but concealed well).I wanted to give it 5.9 honestly because I didn't feel entertained like I do after watching many of those 6/10 good flicks, I rather felt like I maybe wasted my time getting over excited seeing Pierce Brosnan in lead.

James Caan as the old crime boss on his way out is exceptional casting and a killer, pun-intended, role for a master like Caan to have as his final performance. And Morena Baccarin once again punches cliche'd female characters in the nuts and we actually get to watch a real relationship develop, regrets and all.The movie is almost a comedy, definitely a dark one, and had me and the rest of the audience cackle laughing at so many parts I even saw people high five each other after a hilarious and gruesome moment that, let's just say, will make you not want to drink sodas in your car for a very long time.

The film features a noticeable age gap in the love story between Pierce Brosnan and Morena Baccarin, which is handled with a lack of sensitivity and depth. This element of the plot feels outdated and fails to add any meaningful dimension to their relationship.Moreover, the film struggles significantly in the humor department. Despite having opportunities to inject wit or charm, it remains steadfastly serious, missing chances to lighten the mood or endear the characters to the audience. This absence of humor makes the movie feel heavier and less enjoyable than it could have been.Another major drawback of \"Fast Charlie\" is its lack of originality. The plot treads familiar ground, relying on tired and predictable storylines that offer little in the way of surprise or innovation. The narrative feels like a rehash of numerous other action movies, lacking a unique voice or a new perspective to distinguish it from its predecessors.In conclusion, \"Fast Charlie\" is a disappointing effort that suffers from an awkward age-gap romance, a serious lack of humor, and an all-too-familiar plot. The film fails to captivate or provide a fresh take on the genre, making it a forgettable addition to Pierce Brosnan's filmography."

The music is a blend of styles that is both festive and urgent at the right time.The actors deliver the characters as any pro would. Pierce Brosnan's voice in the Louisiana drawl is like music and he nailed that accent. I enjoyed the chemistry he had with Morena Baccarin and as the story developed, it was great to see the unexpected romance that developed between their characters. As for Baccarin, she is graceful and fearless, a compelling combination for a mob wife. Gbenga Akinnagbe is a brilliant actor and nailed his portrayal of Beggar down to a T.The action kept me on the edge of my seat and the humour is pure Southern charm. You keep wondering how it plays out. What you don't see coming are the twists in the plot.The writing was witty and filled with heart and humour. My favourite scene was the monologue in the New Orleans hideout where Charlie talks about his relationship with his father and some of the rough lessons he learned growing up. It was moving and the emotions were authentic.The director's attention to detail shines through. The pacing is dynamic, seamlessly shifting between heart-pounding action sequences and moments of genuine emotion."

Not as action packed as the afore mentioned, but not a bad character for Brosnan. Starts a bit slow as the story unfolds, give it time, then it moves along at a good pace that is very believable and the action is not too over the top. No questionable content, or nudity. Some foul language and quite a bit of gore and blood, a few twists and turns with a surprising ending. Not sure if this will ever have a sequel but could see one being made as a way of keeping the character alive. Great actors and story. Nice emotional part near the end how he takes care of his friend. Not for the squeamish as far as a few gore scenes, but otherwise a mild action movie. I would watch it again. Enjoy!"

It still works somehow.These Irish f@kers - I mean Brosnan and Neeson - keep doing action movies into their seventies, and yet they are totally entertaining and enjoyable. How they do it, I have no idea. It certainly has to do with their acting skills and how well they know the genre itself. Also, with the choices they make when pick a screenplay and the director attached to it.This story goes on a very much Tarantinoesque trajectory, only this is more direct. Hilarious one liners are made during its span, and also it ends up to be a love story with hints along the way. It is Pierce Brosnan best outing since The November Man in the genre, for sure.Well done."

He's doing Biloxi which most people have probably never heard in real life so they are gonna think it's weird but take it from someone from the south, he nails it. All the actors crush. The Freak guy is really weird and skin crawly. Love all the odd stuff too like the girl being a taxidermist and haunting people with their stuffed animals is awesome.

His devoted caring for Caan's character and longing for a Tuscany retirement (if only the right person were with him; enter lovely Morena Baccarin's Marcie) made him an endearing hitman. I stayed engaged and also liked the music. I'm no film buff, but Phillip Noyce's skill is apparent, as is that of his crew. I think most people would leave the theater smiling."

The plot revolves around the infamous town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, grappling with a tragic Black Friday massacre. As the locals gear up to celebrate Thanksgiving a year later, someone decides to deliver festive justice to those responsible.Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), the film stars Patrick Dempsey (Grey's Anatomy), Addison Rae (He's All That), Gina Gershon (Killer Joe), Nell Verlaque (The Marijuana Conspiracy), and Rick Hoffman (Ballers).The movie is truly remarkable. I found myself smiling from the opening scene to the closing credits. It captures a 90s slasher vibe with a plethora of characters who could be the killer, a high school class facing peril, and a relatable motive for the antagonist. The kill scenes are all top-notch, earning a solid 10/10, with a perfect blend of creativity, gore, blood splatter, and more gore. The Black Friday and parade sequences are standout moments, eliciting cheers from tonight's audience. Noteworthy are the elite decapitation scenes and a sequence reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. For a modern-day slasher, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than this. I'd give this an 8/10 and highly recommend it."

I always liked to imagine what this film would actually look like. In all of the ways I envisioned it though, I never foresaw it being as coherent and well put together as this film ultimately was. This movie was a blast.The first thing to note is that the film is absolutely brutal. They haven't toned things down from the original trailer at all. They have committed to the concept and the film is that much better off for it. Like most Eli Roth films it feels like nothing is off limits.I was pleasantly surprised to find the film was done in a whodunit style. The mystery, and not knowing what characters could and could not be trusted, added another layer to the film and worked really well.When we first meet the characters, and in particular the teenage characters, I was a little worried they were going to be extremely unlikable, as is usually the case in these types of films. As the film went on though most, if not all, of them grew on me. And by the end of the film I actually cared about their fate.'Thanksgiving' is going to go down as one of my most pleasant surprises of 2023 for me. It was everything I wanted and more. 9/10."

Thanksgiving is the only Thanksgiving slasher movie I can think of. It is really enjoyable and, somewhat, grisly in parts. Eli Roth has a a unique and twisted mind. Roth does a great job in all of his movies tempering his grotesque imagery and thematic content with humor. This is no exception. The cast is good and strong- had it been a no name Director the film would not have attracted so many named stars. Patrick Dempsey is very good. I liked it."

But then on the other side of the ticket, his overall stories suffer from dull plots and fizzled potential. None of his films aside from the Death Wish Remake awhile back have been fully effective IMO until Thanksgiving.He takes a concept that was conjured up for a bonus trailer styled element within a different movie from 16 years ago with Grindhouse. You wouldn't think the concept could translate to a full feature length but it really does . He does his best 80s slasher impression that actually feels legitimate and not forced. A new age potential iconic slasher is introduced and will absolutely be a new staple of horror genre.The setting is ambient and perfect for the theme and provides a great visual feast. Roth has upped his game in making sure all attention to detail in presentation is covered and even implements a more complete film. The brutality is unleashed and doesn't hold back along with disgustingly fun gore. The cast is also shockingly well put together which is rare in most horror now.Overall a new age holiday themed classic that shows what Roth can offer with the right amount of focus and time. And remember ....be thankful."

One of my all time gorgeous babes. Still got it. Never lost it.And Addison Rae as Gabby, bounding out of social media stardom and into true Hollywood stardom.

You will too.Next Halloween, everyone will be dressed as this scariest Pilgrim, ever.This movie is laugh out loud funny.And the kills are spectacular.Patrick Dempsey is great as he always is.The kids are all great in this.Far superior to this new group of Scream kids we've been given here lately.The movie is wonderfully short.The mood and environment is peak November.It's actually quite beautiful at times.Awesome soundtrack.Humor and action.The killer isn't who you think it is.No, not him.Him, either. Maybe her? No.Dare, I say this is actually one of the best movies of this year?Yes, I do dare. It's fabulous.And stay for the end credits scene. There is an end credits scene.Happy Thanksgiving!"

Those movies were named after holidays or days of the week. My favorite was the 1980 My Bloody Valentine which was a mean, nasty violent flick. That's what you expected walking in after seeing the trailer.This one reminds me of that original slasher flick from the golden age of horror. The make up effects are pretty gruesome and the movie is unapologetically mean and nasty with some clever kills. The back story has been revealed throughout the previews but who the killer is and that third act really got me by surprise.One minute it's playing like a black comedy then the next some dumb idiot is getting chopped up. While some remember those slasher movies from back in the day as bad, fans like me remember the mystery of who the killer is with the big reveal. We went for those Tom Savini make up effects and here you can see these kills kills were heavily inspired by the make up genius. The preview audience I sat with had a great time and fans of horror will too.Just know what you're getting into with an Eli Roth homage to the 80s slasher movies."

I think it's also easily Eli Roth's best film. Actually, for what it is -- an extremely inventive, effective slasher film -- we thought it was genuinely perfect. And it's probably the most I've ever liked Patrick Dempsey in a movie (also cool that he's in this and Scream 3).It's both a throwback to 80s slasher movies, along with 90's slasher movies ala I Know What You Did Last Summer, while also having a modern feel. However, it doesn't repeat what's been done, and makes the tropes feel new.Eli Roth also really takes advantage of everything that he can think of relating to Thanksgiving in both imaginative, clever and disturbing ways.People were talking to the screen while the movie was playing, and after the movie ended, people were standing outside the theater talking about how unexpectedly good the movie was.It turns what could be a gimmick into one of the most fun horror movies in years.

Only a lot gorier.The set-up is classic stalk and slash: one year after a Black Friday riot resulted in several deaths, a masked killer takes revenge on the people who caused the tragedy. It's wholly predictable - so much so that I correctly guessed the identity of the killer very early on - but that's all part of the fun... this is a comfort movie for slasher fans, delivering nostalgic feels, with increasingly splattery kills guaranteed to please gore hounds.And despite the familiarity of proceedings, Roth still manages to conjure up a fair amount of tension, a few scares, and a couple of surprises -- the biggest surprise for me being that this might very well be my favourite horror film of 2023."

It for sure has its flaws though. Mainly, it's pretty impractical that the sheriff would be in multiple places within a very short time frame (both doing his job and doing the killing). Plus the acting and kills were a little too laughable. The best character in the film imo was the party host guy with the guns (played by Joe Delfin). Other than that, it was a creative premise and I'm glad that it became an actual movie and went beyond just being a parody.

The exceptions being Patrick Dempsey's Sheriff who has a kindness steeped in tragedy and Nell Verlaque, who turns Jessica into one of the best final girls horror cinema has offered recently.Even though Eli Roth's direction may lack the grindhouse style of the original idea, it still stays true to his sensibilities whilst breaking some new ground with plenty of sequences that have a good amount of tension before getting to their gory crescendo, which is always a little more unpredictable than expected."

While the prospect of adapting the trailer as a feature had been discussed as far back as 2007, it lingered in development hell either due to Roth's schedule or an inability to get the project to come together. The film finally regained some traction when Spyglass Media Group became involved, and no doubt inspired by the success of the recent Scream films gave Roth the backing he needed to make the film. Thanksgiving is very much truth in advertising and while certainly a straightforward slasher, it's played with a level of charm and irony that I honestly wasn't sure Roth was able to pull off.If you've seen the 80s slashers outside of the major benchmarks such as My Bloody Valentine, Prom Night, or Graduation Day, Thanksgiving follows that same template and is very much a whodunit with a revenge angle much like those other 80s era Slashers that didn't have the cultural exposure of Friday the 13th or Halloween. From the opening scene where Roth introduces key members of the cast at a Thanksgiving dinner before transitioning to a department store with a volatile crowd ready to literally bust down the doors, Roth has fun playing with the Autumnal and Thanksgiving iconography while also indulging in some creative brutality with the Black Friday stampede filled with all manner of shocking violence and dark as black humor that sets the bar high for what follows. While Roth has had a history of creating abrasive characters, here he feels like he's dialed that back so we have a much more humanized set of characters in comparison to something like Hostel or Cabin Fever. Nell Verlaque makes a solid protagonist and we also get some good supporting work from Patrick Dempsey, Rick Hoffman, and Gina Gershon, as well as a scene stealing performance from Joe Delfin as a fun skeezy character named McCarty. What critiques I have are pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, but they still should be addressed. While I thought the cast was good there were times where I didn't learn a character's name until after they had died. I also guessed the killer's identity halfway through the film but even if the reveal didn't catch me off guard there's enough entertainment value throughout that it's forgivable.Thanksgiving is a refreshingly straightforward slasher that mostly plays itself straight with just enough humor while keeping it from going into full on parody. Even if you haven't been a fan of Roth's work in the past I think you should definitely give this a watch."

The brutality and blood were well-dosed, and compared to other films of this type, this one took itself seriously, which is commendable.One of my favorite aspects was the plot twist coming from a genuinely unexpected place and transitioning to the audience (meaning me) smoothly. It was well-executed and surprising. Additionally, the Sheriff's motivation was genuinely good, which mattered to me. The performances were also of high quality, surprising like the other elements.Regardless of everything, the film's seriousness and its approach to resolving events were different. Unlike the terrible horror films that often end with a cheesy, cliché conclusion, this one didn't; it had a clear and open-ended conclusion, which was at least decent and successful.Turning to the negative side, the film sometimes relied on simple things in its transitions and key points (when characters were fighting, for example), and our highly skilled killer sometimes behaved surprisingly absurdly, which I felt the cheesiness of at those moments. Of course, I didn't have excessively high expectations, but it was still noticeable.In short, despite some easy last-minute decisions, it was an incredibly enjoyable film. It questioned how greedy people can be and highlighted their strangely absurd habits when looked at from the outside. Despite some cheesy moments, it left me with entertainment beyond my expectations and became a memorable film. Congratulations to Eli Roth and Jeff Rendell for a beautifully bloody evening entertainment."

The movie earns its strong rating for achieving what it's going for, and surprisingly being better than it could've been. It could've been a movie that was good albeit not memorable. Instead, I'm happy to know I'll watch this on a steady rotation.A movie that has been anticipated for 16 years can easily be internally overhyped to the point where it could fall flat. You can expect a tongue-in-cheek slasher, but you will be rewarded with more: a well done slasher with an interesting plot. As with many slashers, you have a large dinner table full of characters lined up to get killed. Eli Roth made every single one of them stand out with some good character traits. They are likable for the most part. Even most of the characters who have downfalls, can be charming. Even the killer has some moments that are slightly forgiving. The best aspect of the movie is how the thematic plots and killers motive converge in a finale that balances both factors in a rewarding way.Thanksgiving is one the better horror movies of the past several years. It's not because there have been a lot that have been overhyped and/or letdowns, it's because it earns the respect that it strives for. It wants you to have a good time. Have some laughs. Get grossed out by the gore. Be surprised by its intelligent script. When a film not only does what it needs to do, but exceeds in ways that most in the genre don't, then it earns a high grade and a very high recommendation."

                "content": "Thanksgiving starts with a fantastic opening scene. The Black Friday shopping mayhem scene is straight out of South Park, with crazed shoppers rampling people to death in gruesome ways over a free waffle maker. That scene is perfectly acted, with all performers giving a spot on impression of awful greedy trash people. That scene has something to say.The rest of the film starts off as your average \"I know what you did last summer\" style revenge slasher with an unknown killer in a pilgrom costume stalking and killing the people responsible for the opening scene Black Friday tragedy.Towards the third act, the movie further devolves into needless, evil spirited torture porn.A central problem is the main characters, who are a chore to endure. All except the main girl (who seemingly has just one facial expression) and the Russian girl are awful. Especially the males. For a while I wondered if the director / writer were on a dare or pulling a prank by having every single line have the F-word in it. But then a few lines without it showed up. A pity, that would have been more clever than what we got. We are left with intensely unlikeable protagonists, waiting for them to be picked off one by one.The film barely gives us any hints to who the killer is, what in particular he's motivated by, and in the end pulls a random character out of the hat. The only reason I knew it wasn't one of the teens was that Gina Gershon had a brief appearance and death scene in the opening, so I knew the killer had to be connected to her. Otherwise why cast a name actor in a no name role?When the reveal does happen, it's ridiculously stupid, and most of all, the needless cruelty and sadism of the killer goes way beyond revenge. In particular one scene involving the centerpiece of the revenge is sickening, case in point being it's something that happened during the October 7th Hamas attack. It's so messed up that it ruins the tone of what should be a fun, scary holiday slasher / horror film. Eli Roth really needs to get his demons under control. Pushing the boundaries is one thing, but missing the tone of your movie is another.Oddly enough, the gore effects are quite bad. For a movie that goes so deep into gore, I was surprised it didn't look better.Speaking of things that look bad: the Killer's mask. This is a big one, since a slasher film lives and dies by its killer. The killer here looks boring. Like a low budget V for Vendetta, he's neither scary nor iconic. They must have realized the former, because midway during the movie, he burns his mask for no reason other than he knows he's in a movie and wants to look scarier.The film moves at a brisk pace, and thankfully the obligatory scenes of characters nervously tiptoeing through corridors with the Killer lying in wait aren't 5 minutes long like in older 80s and 90s Slashers where the narrative ground to a total halt before every kill scene. They throw in a few chase scenes to mix things up as well.Here's something I'm thankful for: Thanksgiving didn't bore me. It annoyed me with it's nasty characters, it repulsed me with the it's mean spiritedness, bit it didn't bore me.Had they kept the tone and social commentary from the opening scene, they could have had a real classic here. As it stands, this is a missed opportunity let down by a weak script and a director who's pathological need to shock undermines his talent."

D._tv.This is a horror slasher film that is written & directed by Eli Roth and is based on a fake trailer he did back in the 2007 movie, Grindhouse. This film takes place in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the birthplace of Thanksgiving. One year after a Black Friday goes bad-people pushing and shoving and people actually getting killed-a Thanksgiving inspired killer starts killing people using Thanksgiving inspired utensils as weapons. He even dresses like a Pilgrim and wears a John Carver mask-if you don't know him, look him up. Some of the killers' weapons of choice are corn on the cob corn holders, a carving knife, an ax, a meat tenderizer and one victim's whole body is even placed in a huge oven-sprinkled with salt, pepper and herbs, of course-and cooked and then placed on a table. This is NOT your Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving movie. Patrick plays the sheriff, Rick is the store owner, Nell is Rick's daughter and Milo is Nell's boyfriend. Lots of people are likely suspects for being the killer-one person even says, Don't trust anyone! If you stay until after the end credits, there is a blooper shown.It's rated R for bloody violence, gore, language and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.If you like these types of movies, it's a good one. I would buy it on Blu_Ray."

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering \"Can I take my kid to see this?\". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The \"twist\" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think \"Is this a horror film?\". It's not \"balls-to-the-wall\" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies."

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF."

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline \"cheese\", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up."

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10."

Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me."

It's a \"horror\" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again."

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole \"kidnapped little brother\" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film."

They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better."

The way the virtual world was brought to life was brilliant: the costumes, set design, cinematography, etc., were top-notch.But what on earth was going on with the story? Something about a brother being kidnapped and a bunch of 'ghost children' ending up in the robots? I still don't fully get what the hell it was on about.With a better story this could have been a really good film. Also needed a stronger horror element, and more of a 'claustrophobic' feel.It's a shame they didn't go down the route of the game, having the protagonist shut in the security room, trying to keep away from the robots. One of the creepiest things about FNAF is the robots moving without being seen and turning up somewhere else on the security screens, but not once was that used.This film had all the bells and whistles, but it forgets the most important facet: a gripping narrative."

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation."

After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics.

U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he \"still had control of them \" at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action."

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy.

The films are based on the horror game of the same name.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) works as a night security guard at the local pizzeria Freddy Fazbear. He has to work here for five nights, but during these nights he discovers that something is wrong with the pizzeria's animatronic costumes. So he begins to learn about a dark secret.This game adaptation works better for people who are familiar with the horror game, because it contains nice references and other easter eggs that link back to the game. People who don't know the game will not really understand these things.For a game known for its jump scares, designed to frighten and further frighten players, the film strangely has almost none of these horror moments. This film sometimes seems more meaningful to younger viewers of just sixteen. For older viewers, the film is not scary and if they know nothing about the game, the film may be more unclear, or overcome separately.The location of the famous pizzeria from the game seems positive, especially for people who are familiar with it. Since most movie studios didn't use CGI for this movie, the animatronic costumes of the Fazbear crew have to be brought into the movie. Jim Henson's Orphan Shop was responsible for the Fazbear crew. They are performed by puppeteers and stunt artists. This will get her across.However, the story of the film can be a problem for viewers of the film. In addition to the story around the pizzeria, it also tells the story of the main character. In addition to a dark past, he also has a struggle to retain the rights to raise his youngest sister. These storylines do not always correspond well with each other, which means that the film can sometimes be a bit unclear and difficult to overcome.This inferior script sometimes makes it difficult for the actors to come across well. Josh Hutcherson sometimes remains a bit vague. He does come across well as an older brother who tries to take good care of his sister. His sister is played by Piper Rubio, who delivers some decent acting for a novice actress. The brother and sister actors have a well-known bond together. Matthew Lillard also plays a small role in the film, which he portrays appropriately. After his previous acting work in Scream and Scooby-Doo, it is also nice to see him again in this horror film."

(Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, \"That's just a theory...\". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final \"fight\" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back."

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more \"80's slasher\" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though."

                "content": "Fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series were eagerly awaiting the release of the film adaptation, but unfortunately, the results were less than stellar. The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with."

Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics.

It already served as an inspiration for the much better The Banana Splits Movie in 2019.What should be a gory comedy horror movie. Five Nights at Freddy's is a more serious movie about grief and loss masquerading as a horror film.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a security guard with many issues. He cannot get over the fact that his brother was abducted when he was a kid and was never found. Mike is unable to hold a steady job, hooked on pills and has anger issues.Mike cares for his withdrawn younger sister Abby and faces a custody battle over her with his aunt Jane.His career advisor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) gets him a job as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Mike reluctantly accepts as he needs the job to keep custody of his sister.Only when he dozes off at work, it sort of amplifies the events leading up to his brother's abduction in his dreams. He also meets Vanessa Shelly, a cop who seems to know more about the history of the park.Then there are the creepy animatronic mascots. They come alive and kill some delinquents sent by aunt Jane to damage the diner, so Mike would get fired. The mascots later take an interest with Abby as they seem to bond with her when Mike brought her to work one day.This is such an uneven film, I though it was two different kind of movies that got meshed together. The horror parts only comes alive much later. Even then it is tame in order to be a family friendly scary movie.The similar themed Willy's Wonderland was more fun with a silent Nicolas Cage causing mayhem."

                "content": "Another week, another Blumhouse horror film.Based on a video game series (which I have no played), Five Nights at Freddy's is another 80s nostlgia horror flick. The plot revolves around a closed chucky cheese like restaurant from the 80s where the animatronics come to life and murder people.It's a great premise, and the film certainly sets up some interesting ideas, and wisely gives the main characer some agency. He's a down on his luck guy who after losing his family cares for his kid sister, but suffers the same mysterious dream every night. Personally, I would have found it more plausible and interesting if the dreams had begun when he started working at Freddy's which would make more sense in light of the nature of the dream and his interactions therein.Unfortunately, once the female cop shows up, the film begins to come apart. She does not act like a cop at all, being entirely understanding and way too friendly, going for a walk and sitting down with him at the river at their second meeting. Yes, this is (poorly) expained later on, but the writing of their scenes is awful.The best scenes in the film belong to the lawyer of the protagonist's aunt. He's hilarious. They set her up as a great antagonist, only to drop that entire plotline.The animatronics are well designed and sufficiently creepy, but the film shies away from violence and never really commits to being a horror film. It seems to be more geared towards kids, especially with the \"fun\" scenes of partying and playing with the robots, but I'm not sure it really works. Much of the acting is pretty bad (especially the cop), with the protagonist never cracking a joke and wearing the exact same facial expression the entire movie. The second half suffers some real pacing issues, but the worst part is the ham fisted exposition dump that explains the robots. The moment the mystery is solved, you can feel the film deflating as the suspense is all but gone. You instantly know how it's going to end.Matthew Lillard of Scream fame is there again and does what you expect him to do. It drags on too long, and outstays its welcome, especially once we realize the horror we were promised isn't happening.A pity. WIth tighter editing and a bit more energy to the main characer, this could have been great."

To compensate for this, Sandeep Reddy Vanga overcompensates with gratuitous violence to satisfy the enraged crowd watching this trash, never having been involved in as much as a scuffle, much less an actual fight.The plot is as simple as it gets, and it's clear Sandeep Reddy Vanga didn't have a story to tell, as much as a couple of ideas for scenes he wanted to execute based on his diminutive understanding of Marathi music, fetishization of Sikh Youth and culture and more importantly, his bloodlust to satisfy.Such is the bloodlust, that even the post-credits scene is drenched in more blood than most animes, and that's saying a lot."

All things from storyline to music and from action scenes to quality of acting are brilliantly planned and executed. Even though the running time of the movie is almost 3.5 hours you actually don't feel its length.RK has really nailed it this time. This performance can be surely counted as one of his very best in terms of quality of acting. As much as I want to say the same thing for Rashmika, the element of common sense is simply not allowing me. Firstly, the quality of acting displayed by her is disappointing compared to her previous performances. And further I am still not able to understand why someone like her accepted the movie after reading the script.(may be due to RK). The character she plays feels like a clown in the movie.The adult scenes in the movie were forcefully forced into the script and felt very unnatural. The first half of the movie is the most striking and impressive aspect, but sadly it starts to lose momentum every minute in the second half. Unnecessary and untimely placement of songs further declines the experience. The movie deviates from its original plot & theme several times which can be frustrating. Another frustrating part is that several dialogues in English and punjabi language are said so fast that 90% of audience fails to digest them. Lack of twists and turns makes it boring at times. Boby deols screen time is not more than 25 minutes, and that too without a single dialouge, which is again disappointing and surprising because the trailer of the movie makes him look like one of the leads.But all things said, we cannot deny the fact that it is something very fresh and unique, which the audience will love. One of the most aesthetically appealing & enjoyable movie from Bollywood in long time. The message it delivers between a father and son is very beautiful and climax makes up for all the faults it has.Purely a theatre movie will not be that satisfying if witnessed on mobile or laptop."

His abrupt temporal shifts lack clear reasoning, contributing to a disjointed narrative.Despite a touching emotional scene between Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor towards the end, it arrives too late, leaving the audience fatigued and eager for closure. The credit scenes, though appealing, add to the film's unnecessary length.Ranbir Kapoor's character, portrayed as a hero, raises concerns due to his criminal actions, lack of respect for others, blatant misogyny, and attitude problems. The film's attempt to celebrate such a character is problematic, as it glorifies a man-child who in reality needs therapy.Actress Rashmika Mandanna's performance is very poor, making her unfit for the role. She was struggling to deliver convincing dialogue and lacked depth in her portrayal.It's disheartening to witness Bollywood failing with films like \"Animal.\" The industry has the potential for impactful cinema but seems to fall for subpar narratives.

However, as I reached the halfway point, it became evident that he truly deserved the title.Sandeep Reddy Vanga's promise to showcase genuine violence in cinema was effectively fulfilled. In an era dominated by high-budget action films and contrived flashbacks, Vanga dared to create a world where everything is heightened to the maximum, making the violence seem normal and the behavior even more unsettling. One particularly striking scene involves Ranbir, who, after discovering a mole, compels the individual to lick his shoe as a bizarre demonstration of love. It's a level of intensity reminiscent of something Quentin Tarantino might appreciate.Addressing the question of logic, it's acknowledged that the film, like many others, is inherently illogical. Drawing parallels with films like Vikram, KGF, and Bahubali, it's recognized that crafting a movie with absolute logical coherence is a formidable challenge.However, the film does have its drawbacks. The character arcs of certain individuals, such as the mother, sister, and villain, felt underdeveloped. The hero's revenge arc could have benefited from more nuanced writing, and Rashmika's character, while an improvement from Vanga's previous works, still warranted additional depth.In summary, while I wouldn't classify it as a masterpiece, the film has its merits, particularly in exploring the dynamics of father-son and husband-wife relationships alongside the intense action sequences. It's a unique cinematic experience that some may appreciate for its visceral yet somewhat polarizing elements."

Also there is a line to where it gets excessive, but that was crossed way back and you still have to sit through the movie which could have ended at intermission.Hating the fact that this movie is getting a good opening and could have a sequel. *puke*"

Definitely falls under \"The Cult\" category.The boldest director Sandeep Vanga Reddy takes us through the journey of a Son's possessiveness towards his Dad to the volcanic extreme, that he is just replacing love with vengeance, peace with war, gentleness with rage and saneness with madness.Most of the scenes are original and never seen before.Ranbir Kapoor stuns you with the most complex character, and your jaw will be dropped with shock and awe for his mind boggling acting along with various emotions stampede. He just tears open the cinema screen with his brilliance and ease, as he transforms from a raging teenager to animal man, and there is no stopping even with a meteor.This marks him as the best actor of Indian cinema with a launchpad to reach the elites.Having to match him is no easy feat but Rashmika Mandanna does it elegantly with stubbornness and guts.Anil Kapoor is a class apart with his stature and maturity.Bobby Deol is back with a bang. He delivers his career best performance although his screen presence is very short (a bit disappointing).The story is uniquely presented with full heart and woven really well with astounding screenplay and terrific music.Strictly for 18+ years. The alpha man kicks in, with no good social message. Pure violence, rampage and massacre in parts.Wish some uncomfortable scenes were edited, and also movie duration trimmed (first part of second half) as its 3 hours 22 mins long.Animal movie cracks open the movie industry with the boldness and crookedness, and roars loud.Watch at your own risk!"

I was excited to watch it because I liked the trailer, but despite the interesting first half and a great scene before intermission, the entire cast started doing nonsensical things after the break. It seemed like the director instructed them to do anything imaginable to bore the audience until the climax scene, which was somewhat good. Despite the cast's performances, I found this movie extremely skippable. Rashmika was improving, Bobby Deol deserved more screen time, and Ranbir Kapoor's performance deserved a better film. Overall, it's not worth your time. While the background music makes it somewhat watchable, I still recommend skipping it. You might as well go to the zoo and watch a real animal; you'll be done in 1-2 hours, rather than spending more than almost 3 hours and 30 minutes watching this unnecessarily violent, misogynist, low on story cheap adult film with mediocre action and far too many nonsense scenes."

Amidst the exceptions like Bahubali and KGF, this film emerges as a paragon of authenticity. Witnessing moments of emotional intensity, it could be deemed one of the most emotionally charged films to date. The film's pacing is a tale of two halves, with the first delivering entertainment and intensity, while the second gains fervor upon Bobby Deol's entry. Sandeep Reddy Vanga's audacious storytelling steals the spotlight, cementing \"Animal\" as a standout in this year's cinematic landscape. The amount of violence in this movie is overwhelming in a good way, the blood and gore is not for the faint hearted, definitely a benchmark.Ranbir Kapoor's fantastic performance and transitions set this violent revenge saga on fire hands down. Ranbir Kapoor's stellar performance solidifies his position as the superstar of Indian cinema. AK is excellent in the confrontational scenes and Bobby looks menacing, but both have very little to do. Rashmika did a good job. A must-watch for those seeking a gripping and well-crafted film. Highly Recommended."

The loosely written plotlines and characters severely dilapitated Ranbir's character as well because the other characters were so underdeveloped. Lack of motive in even the central character resulted in a lack of conviction in the whole story to such a level that after taking in so much of grandly choreographed violence, one is left scratching head wondering everything happened for what exactly! Emotion got translated i nto only one sided shouting and the viewer is left alone to experience an exhausting and frantic TV debate show where only the TV anchor gets to shout.Severe formula plotpoints and scenes , some of which are inspired from Godfather,OldBoy(2003), The man from Nowhere (2010) Rajneeti and even Kabir Singh were put together in such a way that one is left doubting whether the director wanted to copy from his own previous success just because it worked earlier. But it didn't result in anything like Kabir Singh because everything was so incoherent. The brilliant opening of the movie, by the director's own obcession of using pointless violence (or might be a desperate attempt to cover up the flaws in storyline) got reduced into one and only point- who can shout the loudest! Or thats what a predatory animal is supposed to do- a non-human who shouldn't be part of humane society but gets occassionally breaded by our society. It emanates an excruciatingly agonizing world around it; unable to love, empathize, dialogue & sense of integrity but is just filled with suffocating anger & treachery."

                "content": "The Zone of Interest, the latest film by Jonathan Glazer, is a harrowing and disturbing drama that explores the lives of the Nazi commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, and his wife Hedwig, who live in a house and garden next to the camp. Based on the novel by Martin Amis, the film is a loose adaptation that uses the real names and testimonies of the people involved in the events, rather than fictionalizing them.The film is a masterful exercise in contrast and tension, as it juxtaposes the mundane and domestic scenes of the Höss family with the horrific and unspeakable atrocities happening just over the wall. Glazer avoids showing graphic violence, but instead uses sound, suggestion and implication to create a sense of dread and horror. The film also challenges the audience to confront the banality and complicity of evil, as it shows how the Hösses rationalize, justify and normalize their actions and roles in the genocide.The film features stunning performances by Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel as Hedwig and Rudolf Höss, who portray their characters with nuance and complexity. Hüller is especially remarkable as Hedwig, who oscillates between denial, curiosity, guilt and defiance as she grapples with her situation. The film also boasts a remarkable cinematography by Lukasz Zal, who captures the bleak and oppressive atmosphere of Auschwitz with stark and haunting images. The film's score by Mica Levi is equally haunting and unsettling, creating a mood of anxiety and despair.The Zone of Interest is not an easy film to watch, but it is a powerful and important one. It is a film that does not shy away from confronting the darkest aspects of human nature, but also does not exploit or sensationalize them. It is a film that asks difficult questions, but does not offer easy answers. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends."

                "content": "An absolutely mesmerizing piece of art that challenges and provokes the audience, while also depicting a morbid yet enticingly original perspective on the most infamous and horrific tragedy of all time. Johnathon Glazer's Zone of Interest is not a film to merely watch, but rather one to be absorbed. A paradoxical film, where the most important and powerful images are the ones we never get to see.The concept of the withholding of art being the overarching meaning behind the work certainly isn't reinventing the wheel, but Glazer's presentation and execution puts a spin on the concept in such a unique and cryptic way, it will have you asking yourself if such an idea can ever be done in cinema again.The \"withholding\" begins with the opening of the film. Before the title is flashed onto screen, the audience is treated to a 3-minute synthetic overture in total darkness. A choice that will have you wondering if the projectionist forgot to take off the camera lid. While from a distance it may come across as a mundane or pretentious decision from an amateur director, Glazer is already subjecting the audience to the ethos of his film. The focus is on what we don't see.As Mica Levi's haunting, Aphex Twin remiscent score comes to a close, we are treated to the first image of the film, the Höss family. And for the next 2 hours, we are treated to only images of the Höss family. Never once do we as an audience get to actually witness the horrors of what lies beyond the concentration camp walls. However, that does not mean we are spared.Throughout the film, we feel the effects of the Holocaust without ever truly seeing it. Whether it be the blood-orange glow of the burnt Jewish bodies from the Auschwitz chimney being cast through the window pane of Hedwig Höss' (Sandra Huëller) upstairs guest room. The dichotomy of the Hoss children's playful laughs paired against the sorrowful howls of the tortured souls of the next door death camp. Or the dust remains of decayed Jewish skeletons dumped into the nearby river, ruining Rudolph Höss' (Christian Friedel) canoe adventure with his children. Suffering is felt at every corner of this film. Glazer masterfully crops out the harsh images of the Holocaust, but keeps them just close enough so their presence is still unavoidable. A feeling of historical tragedy that still rings true today.The film is a slow-burn, to say the least. There's never truly an inciting incident, an overly graphic scene of violence, or even really a definitive plot.Yet that is where the art of this film lies, in its subtlety.By introducing images and story-lines that are never fully realized, finished, or even acknowledged, Glazer keeps the audience on its toes by providing only a short glimpse into this family's life, all paired against the gargantuan looming walls of Auschwitz. We see young romance, joust between siblings, and family values, all without ever really learning anything about the family. We are never directly given names, ages, what their hobbies or interests are. Only minute glances at what middle-upper class German family life in the 40s would be ... next to a death camp of course.Oh yeah, the Höss family's idyllic suburban home with 6 rooms and a garden that rivals that of Francis Hodgson Burnett's, is built directly next to the infamous Auschwitz death camp. A property line that excites the family, Rudolph in particular.Rudolph, or Rudy as his wife likes to call him, is the patriarch of the family. A high-ranking officer for the Third Reich, he is one of the head guards at Auschwitz. He is a cold-blooded methodical man, who focuses on efficiency, and has a true love for his work. His wife on the other hand, Hedwig, is a high-ranking officer in an of herself. She runs the Höss family establishment, caring for 5 rambunctious children, enlisting the help of local girls for household duties, and doing whatever necessary to achieve the dream life she had ever since she was a girl, a big house and family.This description of a traditional working man, a traditional wife and their traditional family doesn't sound like much to chew on, but with the next door screams of the innocent reminding the audience who this family is, the film could not feel more tense. To portray a family of Nazis as just your average boring family, reminiscent of an American family in the 50s, is daring, to say the least. But this is exactly Glazer's intention, to bring a perspective on tragedy we have never seen before. One that, from a distance, doesn't seem harmful. But on a closer inspection, finding that the distance is the harm.Glazer however, doesn't only ever submit the audience to monotonous montages of basic family life, though it is prevalent. He instead uses the effect of monotony to then surprise his audience with choices an ideas that would never be seen in a period piece. Every so often, the film will deliver a cryptic sequence or audio effect that is a complete betrayal of the historical drama formula. The first, and most reoccurring of which, being an inverted color, night vision setting on the camera. Without warning, the film will switch to this bizarre camera setting, breaking away from the established world of the film. This subversion adds to the artistic and innovative vision of Glazer, while also avoiding gimmick.The film also has an incredible use of sound design, straying away from historical drama cliches. Rather than including songs or sounds from the 40s, Glazer utilizes the work of sound designer Johnnie Burns to craft a heavy and electronic approach that adds an incredible depth to the film. The sound bellows throughout the theatre and shakes you to your very core. This choice proves to be another masterful decision by Glazer, as it amplifies an undeniable sense of impending doom and scale that no other design could depict.The Zone of Interest is one of the most intrinsically haunting pieces of art I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Its performances, originality, and lead by Johnathon Glazer undeniably makes it the best from Cannes, and one of the best films I've seen in the past decade, if not the best. Its subtlety, unique perspective, and daring choices creates a breathtaking atmosphere and movie-going experience. It's as impressive as a film can get, and represents a true understanding and mastering of cinema as an art form.10 out of 10."

He and wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch."

                "content": "Watched this at its premiere in Cannes without any expectations whatsoever. The premise looks interesting: the head of Auschwitz lives a very paradoxically normal life with his family just behind the wall that separates them from the camp. So normal that it's filled with endless scenes of them eating, brushing their teeth, kids playing, parents reading, even sleeping while nothing else happens. Just as exciting as life in the 40's. And... that's it ! Once in a while, you can barely hear an execution or a scream on the other side of the wall while the family hardly notices at all. What is happening then is left to the viewer's imagination. Throw in some experimental, ominous and unfitting electronic music and occasional uninspired video art gimmicks and you've got a movie. There were enough ideas for a 5mn short film but it looks like the director tried his hardest to extend it into a full-length feature by all means. That was definitely not necessary. He even seemed to notice something else HAD to happen so he found something to spike this giant snoozefest a little bit: Will the husband accept to be mutated somewhere else with a higher rank ? His wife doesn't want him to, she's happy with her family life, while he's hesitant and hopes to convince the kommandantur that he can stay where they are. Big suspense. Not. Because nobody cares.This is not a difficult film to watch because of its supposed tension (there is hardly any despite all the efforts - just go spend a weekend in the German or Austrian countryside and you'll feel just the same) but because it's unbelievably boring, uneventful and empty with shockingly stale dialogue (when there is any). Glazer is no Hitchcock, Bergman or Argento. The raving reviews can only come from people who will praise anything related to the horrors of the Holocaust. This film has nothing."

The only tension came when we thought they might have to move. This movie is living proof that tension is what makes a strong story and keeps audiences engaged. I actually fell asleep for the last 2/4 of the movie. I did wake up when it randomly transitioned to the present day and was confused at first but thought that was one of the stronger parts of the film. I gave it 7 stars because of the earnest effort, the acting (which was boring, but real), and cinematography and locations which were all beautiful. You can't deny it's beautifully shot, but it is literally so boring. I get what the director was going for, attempting to show us how ordinary people can be evil and they are still like everyday people in many ways. But it couldn't hold my engagement. It's definitely an artistic piece and a one time watch. This is a film I'd compare to watching paint dry. I also, didn't know Auschwitz looked like Italian villas? I should research this more, but the buildings were all so much prettier than I've seen in historical photos."

After the first agonising hour, you just want to scream at the filmmaker: you're no Chantal Akerman, no point in trying, just fly lower and put some graft into it. I was seriously tempted to leave before the end, but I kept hoping against all hope; in truth, the fourth and final idea does land in the penultimate sequence, but you still leave with the impression that this should have been a great film, and yet somehow it ends up being a shallow bore."

Thus we see the tops of the well built Austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I, but nothing at all of Birkenau, a mile away, where the worst horrors unfolded. It also matters exactly what month and year we are in (it seems to begin in summer 43) and this is not made clear to the audience, many of who will now know that Auschwitz was first an agricultural research station, then a camp (Auschwitz I) for Polish political prisoners and then part of the holocaust from June 1942. On Hoss himself, whose autobiography is devoid of all human feeling, the film quite disgracefully shows him throwing up at the prospect of being responsible for the arrival of 700,000 Hungarian Jews, as though he cared about that at all. For the rest, the scenes are nicely shot but lacking in cinematic or dramatic interest."

He had no conscience at all. At the end, comically, the auschwitz exhibition of jews' suitcases is juxtaposed with photos of Polish political prisoners with no explanation that the suitcases are not theirs.Above all the film is just boring, like Christian Petzold gone wrong."

Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, \"Love is all Around\" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable.

It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I've seen in recent times, however (I'm just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).It's not trying to be the meaning of life, it's not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it's only trying to do one thing, and that's say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn't end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.This film isn't perfect, I'll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It's superficially complicated but is really a very simple film. It makes a statement: \"love actually is all around\" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else.And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I've read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It's like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually."

Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left.**** (A)"

It certainly wasn't an easy film to make and I'm sure the studio must have considered it a huge risk, telling stories from several characters in the space of two hours, with all of them having little to no connection with the others, but it worked, Richard Curtis clearly put hard work in to this script and gathered a very impressive cast to make it a hit. Of course, with the amount of stories there are, some of them felt underdeveloped, I found Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's to be one of the most compelling, but in the great their story dosen't get any proper closure, Colin Firth's story felt very tight, I would like to have seen more of him with Sienna Guillory, but with a film as crowded as this you are going to feel underwhelmed with certain parts. The films cast really is terrific and is the main reason why a story as complicated and messy as this really works, Liam Neeson shines as a step dad hoping to cheer up the son of his deceased wife, Emma Thompson is delightful as a wife questioning her own decisions, Alan Rickman astounds as a confused husband, Hugh Grant is terrific as a prime minister who discovers love for the first time, every actor puts all their heart in to these roles and they are all a delight to watch. However, the best performance for me would have to be Bill Nighy, who shines in every scene as Billy Mack, playing a character in no way similar to any role he has done previously, he plays a straight up pompous musician, and he does it ridiculously well. Always a fun film to watch at Christmas time, Love Actually is funny, emotional and very sweet, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance film. Set one month before Christmas, we follow the lives of several people falling in or out of love. Best Performance: Bill Nighy"

There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie.

But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is \"number one for Christmas\" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a \"serious\" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is. I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" and \"Duplex.\" Since I've caught it on HBO, and I've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick \"pick me up\" that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument. The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast. I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic."

It's also something of a Who's Who of British acting at the time of its release. Almost every single British actor worth note is in this pile of droppings. Power of Christmas, I suppose, for I see no other reason for them to debase themselves like this.So what exactly is wrong with this film? Well, the few upsides first. It is a nice looking film. The locations are nice, the stories are varied, some even interesting, and it has that Yuletide feel to it. And the actors are talented. There are some truly nice scenes and good character moments. But that's because the actors are so good, not because the script is worth anything.And the stories are terrible. Some are merely bland, like the one containing Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher. Some are just wrong, but in a funny way, like the one with Kris Marshall. But the vast majority of them are more than a bit cringe-worthy. We have over-sexualized prepubescents, a best man wooing after the bride, an adulterer, an import bride and far far too many dudes lusting after women based solely on their looks. And this is supposed to be a Christmas movie about the concept of love. Give me a break!The only decent story, where I actually bought the chemistry and thought it kind of sweet, was the one containing Martin Freeman and Joanna Page. And their characters are porn stunt doubles. That should tell you something about this film."

I'm only kidding. Love really is wonderful, even the struggles. The movie Love Actually, not so much.The first 30 minutes or so are downright hilarious, featuring a mix of charming British humor and broader appeal jokes as well. The setup of each storyline features likable characters in relatable situations. You root for everything to work out. You want all of them to be happy.Then, through no fault of the characters, you change your attitude. Instead of rooting for the characters, you become apathetic, at best. Why? Because the movie makes every story nauseating with irritatingly manipulative music, cuts to closeups of hopeful or gleeful faces to force viewers to elicit the \"hooray\" emotions. It's all very painful and frustrating.The movie is called Love Actually (which is a great title, by the way), but so little of what occurs in the movie can be passed off as something that would actually happen. A more appropriate title would be Love Fantasy.Thirty minutes into the movie (again, the beginning shows promise and is mostly delightful), all the believable buildups have morphed into shameless fairy tale-like sequences. It's all a bunch of love at first sight silliness. Sorry if this sounds too harsh, but there is no love at first sight. The very concept is shallow and supposes a fundamental misunderstanding of what love is. There can be attraction at first sight, or lust at first sight. But not love.The most ghastly instance of using music to manipulate the viewers comes during a scene when two people, who have never spoken a word to each other because they don't speak the same language, develop feelings for each other. That is an interesting idea that could have been quite moving if handled deftly. Instead, the moment is a bit more blunt. The music indicates that the man develops loving feelings for the woman when she takes off all her clothes to jump in a lake. Viewers are led to believe that the man felt little for this woman until he saw that she looked good in her underwear, after which he fell in love with her.So, I guess the message is that you can love someone that you've never spoken to as long and the other person is attractive. It's basically a different version of that thing in movies when the dorky girl takes off her glasses then everyone realizes that she's beautiful and then the main guy character can love her now. The biggest difference between those two cases is that the dorky girl removing her glasses moment usually happens in a movie that clearly isn't taking itself too seriously, whereas Love Actually is posing as a movie that represents realistic love. That's sad to me because many viewers, especially the impressionable young ones, may walk away from this movie confusing attraction for love.Since I'm unleashing all my gripes with this movie, I may as well mention one more. This one didn't so much make me mad, as much as it confused me. It is also kind of funny in a way. I'm talking about the portrayal of the U.S. President (the movie takes place in England). It casts him as this arrogant, smug, woman harassing pig. Basically, he's a bully. So, when one of the British characters stands up to him, the music swoons once again, indicating to the audience that they should be happy that the American jerk couldn't push people around anymore.To be honest, I have no idea if this is the perception that people in England have of Americans. Perhaps it is, and the viewers from England really did applaud this moment. But I personally found it all to be laughably cheesy.That's a pretty accurate summary of my take on the movie overall---laughably cheesy. I'll just leave it at that. I recommend that you take a hard pass on Love Actually."

You could spend ages just trying to work out where the various connections between the story lines actually were.But there were two very special moments for me in this film. One was where Mark (Andrew Lincoln) finally told Juliet(Keira Knightley ) how he REALLY felt about her, through the medium of the messages on the cards, (surely many of us have experienced that sort of unrequited love), the other was the brilliant brief speech given by the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) to the press conference at which the American President was present. (Both of these appear as quotes elsewhere on this site.) I felt that it was a very brave move on the part of the writer (Richard Curtis) to allow the Prime Minister in the film to state what so many ordinary British people are feeling about America and its politics right now. I also feel that we, the British, are finally beginning to move away from under the Hollywood shadow, and are starting once again to produce some really excellent films of our own.

It's not really about being in love, it's about the happy, giddy feeling of infatuation - it neglects to mention all the deeper emotions and complications which arise when you are in love with someone, and whenever it looks like it might start to get close to that (a grieving widower, a wife who suspects her husband has fallen in love with someone else), it makes sure it moves quickly onto something lighter. It's very badly written - vacuous and predictable, and somehow both unnecessarily vulgar and repellently sickly-sweet at the same time - which is a shame since its writer-director wrote some of the best British TV comedy of the eighties. Visually, it's tedious, and its soundtrack consists entirely of bland love songs. Its only asset is its huge cast, but since none of them have anything interesting to do or say they are mostly wasted. Big stars like Neeson, Rickman and Thornton are just plain slumming, Grant does his insufferable usual charming Lord Snot routine and most everyone else is just a Pretty Person. Only Linney and Thompson come close to drama and only Nighy (as an ageing Rod Stewart-type lothario rocker) says anything funny. If you want to see a real movie about love, made by grownups, watch any of the films of Ingmar Bergman, John Cassavetes or Nicolas Roeg, not this bland, superficial, ingratiating pap."

I've seen it about half a dozen times since!Love Actually has 9 plots that go back and forth about love in London at Christmastime. Usually I would sit down and summarize each one, but instead I will suggest Googling Daily Dot's ranking of the plots and immediately discuss what I enjoy about the movie as a whole.Romantic comedies are hit or slight miss for me. Religious convictions aside, I think it's stupid for sex to advance the romances in these movies.People fall in love because of who they are, their character, their beauty-inner and outer, likes, interests, etc. and NOT BECAUSE THEY BANG EACH OTHER AFTER BARELY KNOWING EACH OTHER!Love Actually does have some sex in it(Hence it's R rating), but there are all kinds of love in the movie. For example, a stepfather named Daniel gives his stepson advice about how to get to know his love, showing a father-son bond. Daniel also asks if the crush is a boy, hinting that he loves his son no matter his sexual orientation.One woman has a boyfriend AND a mentally unstable brother, and she sacrificed her dating life for her brother. She could have done the cognitive and gave up her brother, but she knew family came first and her brother mattered more.There is also some homosexual love, pointing out that romantic love comes in multiple forms as well.Aside from the love aspect, other things make Love Actually fantastic. The movie's no Citizen Kane, but every moment is so entertaining and well written.Ignoring a pointless plot with sex scene stand ins, there's not a thing I'd change about the movie.

I think the reason for our divergent views is that in most romance novels, all the nice people get the love of their lives by the end of the film. However, in LOVE ACTUALLY, some do but others do not. So, if you need to have a romance where everything works out perfectly, this is NOT the film for you. However, if you are like me and don't mind a bit of ambiguity about the characters, then you are sure to love this film.This story is a complicated film where there are many different stories occurring at the same time just before Christmas. What ties this all together is that the various stories all relate to each other somehow. In other words, this film is about people and their friends also have separate stories that diverge. I rarely have seen this type of film work so well.I could spend a lot of time talking about all the plots but I won't bother. Part of this is because there isn't enough space here to adequately do it and part of it is because there are tons and tons of very thorough reviews already on IMDb for this film, so I don't want to plow familiar ground. Read these longer reviews if you are interested in a play-by-play analysis.Instead, understand that some of the romances work out perfectly, others are uncertain and others are heart-breakers--just like in real life. In fact, that's the beauty of this film. While you really can't believe all the plots (some are very, very far-fetched and silly), all the people talk like real people. And the romances are just so adorable and sweet you can't watch this film and keep a dry eye. Plus, in the cases where the romance fails, I liked them as well because they all had wonderful object lessons for us all.Amazingly acted, directed and written--this is one case where a popular film actually deserves all the hoopla. In the UK it's sold like a bazillion DVDs and I can see why.By the way, there were only two things about the film I did not particularly like. First, the Prime Minister's love interest (Natalie) was a lovely woman but repeatedly throughout the film they made fat jokes about her. This made no sense, as she was gorgeous and the comments tended to reinforce the stereotype that a beautiful woman must be stick-thin--like Keira Knightley. Even if she was overweight, which she wasn't, this is gross to say and the film made it seem cute or funny to do so (not just with her but with a Portuguese lady as well). She was curvy and even if these gross comments were true, women are supposed to have curves and not be anorexic!! Second, the scene where the little boy runs through security really, really annoyed me. In reality, the kid would have either been shot or arrested and the airport would have been shut down--yet the movie shows no consequences for this insanely stupid and selfish behavior. Neither problem ruined the film but they did detract from my enjoyment of an otherwise brilliant movie."

It addresses different forms and levels of love, sometimes straightforward and carefree, sometimes complex and contradictory. There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness. The movie is made up of many threads, and of course some threads are stronger than others.The most interesting parts of Love Actually are the times when it addresses the tragic situations where love is self-sacrificing, contradictory, or fragile. One character's unrequited love is revealed as a noble sacrifice made for another's happiness (the method of finally achieving closure and moving on, however, could only work in the movies). Another character is shown to be caught between conflicting duties that will, we are led to believe, prevent her from ever being truly happy. And the strength that a third shows when love is shown to be fragile and her world collapses around her is tragically inspiring.These noble, tragic threads are interwoven with lighthearted comedic ones to produce a fabric that holds together well. While some characters have to fight for their love, others have simple, happy, straightforward relationships, with love (or whatever) falling in their laps like a parcel from Santa Claus. And the purely comic moments, like Rowan Atkinson's appearances and Hugh Grant's Christmas-caroling bodyguard, are delightful in and of themselves.There are of course plenty of nits to pick. Hugh Grant doesn't make a very believable Prime Minister, and even his very pointed speech to his American counterpart -- especially relevant in light of Bush's recent state visit to England -- don't redeem the odd casting. Others in this forum have commented on the number of fat jokes in the film, and while I agree, I feel I should point out that the entire point of the first such joke is that the character who has fallen for the \"fat\" girl clearly doesn't think of her as fat, and doesn't understand at first who the other is talking about. It's true that calling her fat is ridiculous; she's only large in comparison to Keira Knightley, who must be carrying some vital organs around in her handbag because there's certainly not enough room in her torso! But that one time would have been enough; the \"fat\" theme gets tiresome later on in the movie. I also agree with those who have said that much of the nudity is completely unnecessary to the plot, and that at least some of the comedic threads in the movie are formulaic and unoriginal.In the end, I feel that Love Actually is for the most part a thoughtful and entertaining look at relationships, which does not shy away from taking the bad with the good."

You can see love in different ways, observe people's feelings, and understand what people can do for their loved one.It also has a pretty good cast. This film follows the lives of eight very different couples. With it you can believe that a miracle really happens, because someone can even fly to another country, learn another language, just to see their love, to ask to get married knowing that she can refuse.So, It's romantic, funny and everything happens at Christmas. I highly recommend watching this movie, especially if you can watch it with your loved one. It will bring you a good Christmas mood and you will enjoy it!"

Family love, friendship love, partnership love makes this film so readily available to everyone. It hits in all the right spots from STELLAR acting to phenomenal writing and directing. My only gripe is the lack of diversity but the director and writer has even publicly agreed with that. The score is iconic, the plot is so loveable, the characters redeemably quaint. I honestly question people who dislike this film or haven't seen it in the 20 years it's existed."

Due to our traditions, we celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve rather than day yet I digress. After the wonderful success of this film there have been many like it, but it still doesn't have the character development and beauty that this one has.It is funny, touching, and endearing. Although parts could have been better edited and characters could have been removed, it still is a fantastic watch. I have seen some of the other stories that were originally planned, and those should have been added. I long for the day where a remastered version is included with the original cut, which was over three hours.This film has inspired American versions that attempt to be wholesome and romantic entertainment yet the movies fall flat. I saw two, by chance, at an early screen. Audience members were leaving complaining of plagiarism. This movie is original, and Curtis is a great writer of romantic comedies.This movie is rated R in America. There is nothing in it that is really that bad. There are the occasional swear words, and that is about it. This movie is a great Christmas movie for you and your family."

John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

                "content": "This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word \"action\" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, \"moral dilemma\", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the \"one guy versus lots of bad guys\" sub-genre of the action flick."

                "content": "\"Nine million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister.\" Well, what else can I say besides that this is \"THE\" (can't stress it more) action movie from the 80's with a young Bruce Willis. Personally, I don't even know how many times I've seen this movie. \"Die Hard\" remains an example for all action movies that followed. At that time you had the Sly and Arnie action movies. But these were more a performance of brutal violence, with big muscles and a sense of invincibility. Bruce showed a clever, shrewd, caustic action hero, who can take a beating, but on the other hand shows that he's not completely invincible.Of course, the action in films nowadays is much bigger, more impressive and mind-blowing, but the strength of this film is the story, the accumulated tension, lightness and the dry humor of Bruce Willis. From the first minute he takes you in his grip, and he won't let loose. You see him slowly evolve from a wrinkle-free clean-shaved top cop into a reasonable damaged hero. This pattern keeps coming back in the next two parts, which are also top movies of the same caliber.You'll notice this is already an old movie because for instance lighting a cigarette in a public place isn't prohibited. But how the action scenes are imaged, is still top-work and should be the aim for many action flicks.I think the sudden confrontation between Gruber and McClane is one of the strongest scenes in this film, along with the well known \"Yippie-kay-yee\" cry. Trademark of Willis. The fact he likes the character of McClane a lot, you see clearly in \"The Last boyscout\". In that movie he plays an impoverished detective with the same coolness and cynical, dry humor as McClane. Too bad that in the last two Die Hard movies, McClane is only a shadow of himself like in the original movie.\"Die Hard\" is one of those rarities in movie land, which you can watch without thinking \"Pfft Again this movie\". It remains, for me, an enjoyment to watch.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

                "content": "In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with Die Hard. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic TV Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bled and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying \"I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite.\" Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc. In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with. I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made. Yippie-ki-yay *muddy funster*... and happy holidays.Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

                "content": "Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10"

                "content": "In the late 1980s, Director John McTiernan refined the action film genre with this action- packed thriller that not only stars Bruce Willis is the role that defined his career, but also brought impressed audiences everywhere with ecstatic action sequences complete with amazing practical effects, inspiring characters, and one of the most original scripts for an action movie written for its time. This movie stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who heads on vacation to Los Angeles for the holidays, to spend Christmas with his wife Holly Genero (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and kids. Upon arriving at the Nakatomi Plaza building where she works, he and his wife ended having an argument dealing with family matters. Their dispute is eventually interrupted when the building becomes under attack by a dozen German terrorists lead by the ruthless Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who's intent on robbing the company of its money. Pitted against overwhelming odds and Gruber's diabolical mind, John McClane must take matters into his own hands and fight off the terrorists who have his wife, along with hundreds of innocent civilians held hostage, with no aid from the Los Angeles Police Department who are helpless against the terrorists' overwhelming power.My family and I catch this fi on cable almost every year during the Christmas season and this never gets old. Unlike other action films from the 80s that spit cheesy little one-liners and mindless gun shootouts, this film presents viewers with a very likable protagonist who is self aware with his flaws and has feels very human, a Villain who is near equally likable and incredibly smart, and the dialogue between these two characters (which are spoken via walkie-talkies for the majority of the time) is very witty and clever that keep viewers' attention. The main character John McClane spends most of the time fighting off the terrorists who are lead by Hans Gruber, and the scenes are exciting to watch. Glossing with intense gunfights, explosions, stellar camera-work and fight choreography, the scenes keep viewers strapped to their seats. In the scenes when the action lightens up, there are some interesting conversations between characters like McClane, who at one point, shares a tender moment with a cop by admitting his flaws as a husband and a man as a whole. These moments are make you feel for the character and are presented in a realistic way and not sappy way. Bruce Willis does an excellent job as the main character and his performances him as the action hero he is today, along with his famous line \"Yippie Kay Yay, motherf***er\". The same can be said about Alan Rickman is gives off a performances as the one of the most charismatic antagonists ever put on screen. What really impresses me about this film is the action set pieces. The Nakatomi Plaza that serves as the film's main setting (at least during the beginning) is shot nowhere other than Twentieth Century Fox headquarters. Quite interesting!Die Hard is one of the most influential action films ever made and shines with nearly every aspect an action film needs. It is a good movie for viewers to pop a bag of popcorn, sit on the couch, and watch. Director John McTiernan did a fantastic job with this film as well as the cast. This film is a textbook example of what action films need to be and a movie that every action fan should not miss."

It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like \"Die Hard.\" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) McClane shot's Hans and Eddie \"Happy - Trails, Hans...\" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - \"kick ass.\" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today."

                "content": "(In brief) By any measure, \"Die Hard\" was a pretty muscular movie back in '88. It made cultural icons out of its two stars and the explosions were guaranteed crowd pleasers. The script (note-perfect) ran like clockwork with setup-and-payoff and was stocked with memorable characters throughout; the hero reluctant and vulnerable, his stakes ever ratcheting, while the action would just keep mounting until . . . Well, there wasn't any more opulent high-rise. It doesn't matter what time of year you watch this movie, it functions perfectly in July and December (or even today, so close to Halloween) and always his the spot. It's the ultimate \"You can't go wrong with\" movie.(Less brief) After twenty minutes of story setup, BAM! The guns start blazing and the death toll gets going. At a certain point, this just becomes kind of a theme park ride as John McClane scrambles through the bowels of Nakatomi Plaza and everything's raining down around him.McClane is the key to making all of this work after all. He's the ideal rally-behind character, neither hulking nor shredded and always thrust into a fight; and Bruce Willis is working at peak likability. But he's matched by Alan Rickman, the master scene-stealer, as devilish as they come. It's a rivalry commensurate with such a big movie.And McTiernan's the perfect director for this gig. His direction is self-assured, his camera calm and measured. Sure, we're confined to this building the whole time, but the audience had plenty of moments to take a breath and soak it in. Put it this way: can you imagine someone like J. J. Abrams helming this? Stock up on Dramamine first.I can go on and on, but the bottom line is this: \"Die Hard\" is just *fun*. There's joy in the gunfire, personal injury and wanton property destruction. I always feel great after watching this."

There's a lot of very good things about this movie but I've always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it's easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what's so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he's just your typical guy you'd see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate. DIE HARD might be far-fetched in what one man is able to do but this really doesn't take away from any of the fun."

Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's \"Moonlighting\" and 1987's \"Blind Date,\" which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.Willis was a wild card - an unlikely choice for the role of our hero \"John McClane\" - since he didn't have any action credits on his resume' and let's face it: Bruce Willis just didn't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this. But that's the beauty of his performance in this movie: he's an everyday guy, caught in a not-so-everyday situation.On Christmas, McClane's estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) invites him from New York all the way out to Los Angeles to spend the holidays with the family. But it requires him to make a stop at the Nakatomi offices, which is having an after-hours Christmas party. Riding for the first time in a limo, he's introduced to the suave driver, Argyle (De'voreaux White), who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.At Nakatomi, things of course get off to a rough start for McClane, as he gets into an argument with the wife and is left to wallow in his misery. However, those problems are about to take a backseat to the real \"party\" - twelve terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (all-purpose bad guy Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) - seize control of the building and proceed to rob the Nakatomi building of its assets, most of which include negotiable bonds and other valuables. But they didn't count on the \"fly in the ointment\" (pain in the a**) to make things hell for these so-called party crashers.Certainly one of the best known action movies ever, \"Die Hard\" did receive the scorn of critics upon its 1988 summer release, but the audiences sung a completely different tune.The film was most often praised for the production, with the brand-new Fox Plaza office tower serving as the fictional Nakatomi building. It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller \"Predator,\" which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance, since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one. If Stallone or Schwarzenegger were in this movie, I'm sure the effect would have been a lot different.Personally, I think \"Die Hard\" is one of the greatest action movies ever, up there close to my favorite action movie of all time, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" Like Indiana Jones in that film, \"Die Hard\" had an Everyman cast in the role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.10/10"

It's Bruce Willis in a version of saving humanity along the lines of John Wayne, Rambo and Marshal Dillon. Personally, John McClane had me when he said he was partial to Roy Rogers because that's who my favorite TV and movie cowboy was as a kid growing up. I'd bet that someone might say that of Willis some day.In his own way, John McClane must have had some sort of mystical power because up until the point he started crawling through the transom feeling like a TV dinner, his wife-beater t-shirt was white with some blood spatter. But when he hit the floor again to do battle with the bad guys it suddenly turned brown. So mesmerized was I by this turn of events that I never even noticed when the shirt turned a neat dark forest green later in the picture. I wonder how stuff like that gets by the director? Say, and how about the FBI sending in a double Johnson to take over the attack at Nakatomi Plaza? I'm sure there's a pretty good punch line in there somewhere but I think I'll just let it go for now.It's been stated, and rightly so I think, that this film set a new standard for action/adventure flicks with Bruce Willis portraying a new kind of hero. He's smart, thinks on his feet, takes what help he can get, and engages in wise-ass banter to keep the audience fully engaged. All the noise, explosions and crashing glass is merely window dressing to keep the story moving as our hero saves the day. What more can you ask for in a two hour action flick? You know, if this was a Roy Rogers Western it would probably have a title like \"Under California Stars\". If I had to guess, I'd say Bruce Willis saw that one when he was a kid."

This level of raw, \"edge-of-your-seat\" action was unknown to me prior to this film; it made my head spin and the intensity of it was nearly unbearable. When it was over, I could only think of one word: Wow!For a long time - at least in western cinema - the only \"true\" action movies (by that I mean films that were all about the action and you went to see them because of the action) were the 'James Bond' movies. They had the most unreal stunts and crazy, over the top action sequences that you could imagine at the time, and they were (and still are) great fun. However, they usually lacked three vital ingredients:1. A sense of realism (meaning: the hero is only human and can get hurt)2. Grit (messy, unpolished action, dirty people and LOTS of swearing)3. R-rated violence (showing the audience what real weapons do to the human body)Well, it took John McTiernan to bring those three key elements together in 'Die Hard' - and thus the modern action film was born (it had a good run through the late eighties until the end of the nineties – then the studios figured out they could maximise the box-office by taming down the swearing, violence and sex and thus, alas, the contemporary, toothless PG-13 action film was born). Sure, there have been a couple of others before McTiernan's masterpiece ('First Blood', 'Terminator', 'Predator' - which was also by McTiernan - or 'Lethal Weapon' and probably some more), but those films could have fallen into any number of other categories as well ('Adventure-/Survival-/War-', 'Sci- Fi', 'Horror-' or 'Buddy-movie') – and I can't think of another film that was just such a relentless, pure-action-from-the-beginning-to-the-end film as was 'Die Hard'. To me, it's the ultimate thrill ride. The formula has since been repeated so many times, but the original still sets the standard by which I judge an action film.

                "content": "\"Die Hard\" is the prototype type for the modern action film. Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing. \"Die Hard\" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since \"Die Hard\" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of \"Die Hard\" . . . or, for that matter, is better than \"Die Hard\". \"Die Hard\" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.  Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim. The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over. There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out. (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, \"Die Hard\" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written. McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action. A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, \"Die Hard\" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all. With \"Die Hard\", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.As for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect. Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane. As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure. There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero. Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism. The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant. (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.) There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber. The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route. Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero. He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand. Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains. As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good. Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual \"damsel in distress\" mold. It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero. The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.\"Die Hard\" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly. There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film. Is \"Die Hard\" one of the best overall movies ever made? Probably not. But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film. Grade: A"

                "content": "Die Hard tells the story of a New York City detective named John McClane who is separated from his wife. She invites him to a Christmas party at her office building in Los Angeles, and he decides to go to work things out. Once there, a group of German terrorists come in and take hostages with the intent of stealing millions of dollars in bonds. McClane manages to escape and begins to fight the terrorists one by one to save the people in the building.Die Hard is a classic film because it completely revolutionized action films. The 80s were a time of unrealistic action sequences, predictable characters, and rudimentary plots. Die Hard changed all that. Die Hard takes place in a real world setting, or at least about as real as you can get with an action movie, so the action sequences, while insane, are slightly believable. The plot of the movie is simple, yet it's so brilliant at the same time. And the characters in this movie are engaging and a lot of fun to watch. John McClane is a really likable everyman kind of guy, we can all relate to him. Hans Gruber is an awesome villain, both cold and ruthless, yet very human. The supporting characters on the outside of the building are all great as well. Another great thing about Die Hard is that even though it's a hardcore action movie, it manages to be extremely funny at some parts, almost to a point of being able to call it a comedy. This makes the movie really easy to watch over and over again. There's really nothing wrong with this movie whatsoever in any department.The acting is great. Bruce Willis is hilarious and hardcore as John McClane, and he portrays the adrenaline and the frustration of the situation very well. Alan Rickman is awesome in one of his earlier roles as the main villain Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson is enjoyable as McClane's outside contact Officer Al Powell, and Paul Gleason is funny as a hardheaded and incompetent deputy chief of police.Overall, Die Hard is the ultimate action film because it's fast, funny, and hardcore. It also gave us one of the most famous action movie one liners of all time...You know the one.8/10"

                "content": "I first saw Die Hard in the late 1980's and have owned it on various formats down the years and will watch it now and again. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a \"normal\" guy as our hero. Now I won't pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from  if you rely totally on technology then you'll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you'll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980's, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar \"man's man\" type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines (\"ladies & gentlemen\"); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans' ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start  John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist  the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between \"man's man\" and \"new man\"  a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a \"quick-draw\" style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid \"buddy\"; Godunov is a real physical threat  even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced. The performances suit the material and, if you want it, there is a clever and engaging subtext running across the whole film. I find it hard to fault and you can see why it has had the influence it has had on the action genre over the last twenty years."

So, I gave it a watch, guided by the many, many Jake Peralta jokes that I had grown accustomed to. And I've got to say, this is the action movie that paved the way for all future action movies.I usually have an aversion to Christmas movies as they all tend to turn into cheesy rom-coms but this was pretty awesome. And I think the reason for that is because that even though it was Christmassy where it mattered, the plot didn't completely revolve around it.I've got to admit, most of it was guns and explosions and there was very little plot to go off of besides a pretty traditional three-act structure, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. And you know it's a good movie when about 90% of it was guns and blood and explosions and the other 10% was Bruce Willis saying badass things and crawling through vents in an ever-disintegrating tank top, and you stilled enjoyed it.There was never a still moment in this movie, but unlike most times, where I just end up getting bored of the CGI-fest explosions, I was actually pretty captivated through the entire runtime. I'm actually really pleasantly surprised. The ending is predictable, but it's nice. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. Sometimes you just need to switch your brain of a little and watch Bruce Willis kick ass.So, Jake of B99 was right.

I have seen many action films in my life, but this ranks at the top as it has all the right components. Action packed sequences, explosions, special effects and most of all superb performances with excellent dialogue.\"Die Hard\" is a movie I will not soon forget because the story is so well crafted.

I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said 'Okay boys, watch out I'm taking over.\" They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.On a scale of 1-10; \"Die Hard\" is given a 100 by yours truly.

And yet, even then, it will still remain in its position as indisputably the greatest action-adventure ever committed to the screen. In every way remarkable, entertaining and breathlessly exhilarating, it is the quintessential gold-standard when it comes to action. A masterpiece of filmmaking, \"Die Hard\" took the world by storm in 1988 and even with inconsistent quality in sequels, it still enthralls and entertains thanks to sharp writing, perfect casting, exquisite performances and top-notch direction. It's hard to imagine that anything will ever top it.Bruce Willis stars as Detective John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and children. Arriving at a massive Christmas Party at Holly's workplace in Nakatomi Plaza, things start to seem like they might be looking up for John... until a group of terrorists, lead by the vile Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building, hoping to get their hands on over half a billion dollars in bearer bonds that are locked away in the vault. Escaping the threat and discovering that the police will be completely unable to help, John realizes he must work alone, eluding capture and taking out terrorists one by one if he is to save the day...Directed by John McTiernan from a script by Jeb Stuart and Steve E. de Souza, the film as just exquisitely assembled. McTiernan's keen eye for visuals and perfect sense of pacing and composition allow the tension and excitement to build with virtually every second as the story progresses and the stakes rise. But he also knows when to pull back and give the characters breathing room to develop and just talk with one another, without rushing through it or over-relying on broad archetypes as many more modern filmmakers do. Absolutely amazing direction. The screenplay (inspired loosely by the Roderick Thorp novel \"Nothing Lasts Forever\") is exceptionally well put- together. de Souza and Stuart craft an instantly identifiable and highly likable cast of characters- including villains you very much love to hate- that all get their proper moment to shine and all feel well-defined and developed. The structure of the film is also very sound, and they strike a perfect balance between story and action in a way few other films have.We are treated to one of the finest casts to ever populate a tale of adventure in the film. Much has already been said about Bruce Willis and his iconic turn in the role of McClane, but it is still not enough. Bruce Willis just might be the ideal action hero. He's tough, but not unstoppable. Smart, but not a genius. And sharp- witted, but with a certain sense of vulnerability. In many ways, he's the sort-of person anyone and everyone can identify with, and that's what makes McClane such an incredible hero. Alan Rickman- in his first starring role- absolutely steals the show as the villainous Hans, a presence who will charm you, even while you root for him to go down. Rickman is a talent that was taken too soon after his tragic passing last year, and it's roles like this that prove just how great a loss it was. Supporting roles by the likes of Bedelia and William Atherton are exceptional for the material. And Reginald VelJohnson is just magical as Sgt. Al Powell, a cop who offers support to McClane over the radio throughout the film's runtime.Beyond the cast, the direction and the writing is just simply a phenomenal overall production. Cinematographer Jan de Bont, who would later go on to become a director in his own right, paints a beautiful cinematic image, with outstanding work done, particularly in the lighting and color. Composer Michael Kamen's score is just a blast of pure fun. With a sort-of old-fashioned scope yet a modern flair, the music constantly and consistently compliments the images on-screen perfectly, and it's such a relief that his themes were used in each subsequent film. And editors Frank J. Urioste and John F. Link expertly manipulate the footage so that every shot... every emotion... everything is in service to the story and characters. Now THIS is how you film and cut an action film!In the end, \"Die Hard\" may soon be turning thirty years old, but it remains as exciting, engaging and enthralling as ever. Upon initial release, it became the perfect example of an adventure done right, and blew audiences away. And it continues to do that now. I honestly have my doubts that anything will ever be able to beat it in terms of quality in storytelling and execution of action. It simple is the best action movie ever made. And for that, it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10."

                "content": "I've decided to leave a review for 'Die Hard' exactly thirty years since its release in 1988. Partly because it still holds up after all that time as one of the greatest action movies ever made and, secondly, because it has just (officially?) been classified as a 'Christmas movie.' So, does it promote festive cheer and goodwill to all men? Or does it just give you the manual on how to kill unlimited bad guys with a machine gun, a witty quip or two and dirty feet. Probably the latter really, but, for the record, it is SET at Christmas and a famous Christmas song even plays it out. What more do you need to pull a cracker and eat Xmas pudding to?For anyone that doesn't know, the plot to 'Die Hard' involves a cop getting stuck in a giant building during a terrorist takeover. Guess what? He fights back. It's a simple plot and that's its main strength. It never really tries to be anything that its not. Bruce Willis may have been around before 1988, but it was no doubt that it was 'Die Hard' that cemented him as an 'A-list' star. Granted he's reprised his role as John McClane numerous times since, however one (of the many!) criticisms thrown at the sequels is that he's become a 'superhero' in human form, i.e. he can do anything and is completely invulnerable. But, back in the first outing, we really do feel his pain as he limps, crawls and drags his way through the building's air ducts in order to simply survive the night, let alone take out the entire squad.In short, Bruce Willis was actually 'relatable' back then. But, what is a hero without a good villain? Not much. But luckily, as 'Die Hard' cemented Willis as an A-list protagonist, it also did the same for Alan Rickman as the dastardly terrorist leader, Hans Gruber. I read somewhere that the best films involving a clearly defined hero and villain explore the relationship between them (test it out - the movies that don't really work almost always have the hero and villain never meeting/interacting until the final showdown where the hero inevitably kills the villain). Here, the two spar not just physically, but mentally thanks to McClane stealing one of the terrorist's radios and mercilessly taunting Gruber as he dispatches one henchman after the next.So, you have the relatable hero, the evil villain and the simple plot. What more could you want from an action movie? Well... action, maybe? And it's here tenfold. The wonderful thing about eighties action movies was that they were real. Or rather the special effects were really there on screen, rather than the actors filming up against a green screen and the explosions added later. All the fights here actually look like they could really happen. Yes, we always have to suspend our disbelief that one man shooting at a hundred has a better chance of killing them than the other way round (but then we've been doing that since James Bond first sipped his Martini!). But the action looks real and it's the final icing on this most unexpected Christmas cake.Die Hard' may now be a Christmas movie, but you really can watch it any time you want a simple, yet excellent action film that really doesn't have many flaws (or at least none that detract from its brilliance). It really has been the template for many an inferior action movie to come. Yippie-kay-yah Christmas to you all!"

                "content": "I've seen many action films over the years, but few have had an impact like Die Hard. Bruce Willis gives one of the best (if not THE best) performances of his film career. This is quite simply, my favourite action film of all time.Willis plays NYPD cop John McClane, who has come to LA to be with his estranged wife Holly, (Bonnie Bedelia) and their children for Christmas. To my knowledge, Die Hard is one of the few action films set at Christmas. This makes Die Hard rather unique for the genre, but the seasonal setting does nothing to detract from the action, and its still a gripping film to watch.Getting back to the plot, McClane heads for the Nakatomi Plaza, a 40 storey skyscraper, Holly's workplace, to pick her up from the Nakatomi Corporation's annual Christmas party. But just after a heated discussion concerning the breakdown of their marriage, a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (the brilliant Alan Rickman) seize control of the building.McClane manages to escape detection, and where the action kicks into overdrive. Willis makes a very likable hero as John McClane, because he comes across as a more down to earth guy than other action heroes. An example is when the terrorists first seize the building, but instead of trying to be a hero, he just runs and tries to call for help.This is believable behaviour to me, and you would expect anyone thrust into the same situation to do just that. Since the action is confined to an LA skyscraper, it makes for a more claustrophobic atmosphere and environment. With McClane crawling through air ducts and elevator shafts, the camera angles have you right in his face. In some ways, Die Hard reminds me of The Towering Inferno, the classic Irwin Allen film also set in a skyscraper. But they are still two very different films, with Die Hard being more about action.McClane must now wage a one man war against Rickman's terrorists. It may sound ludicrous for one man to single-handedly pick off a group of heavily armed terrorists, but in this film it works. I think its because of Willis' likable performance of an ordinary man plunged into an extraordinary situation. I like the way he wears that white vest, that becomes increasingly dirtier as the film goes on. To me, this symbolises his transition from ordinary joe to the one man army he's been forced to become.Alan Rickman oozes evil as Hans Gruber, who is principally interested in the 640 million dollars worth of negotiable bearer bonds in the Nakatomi building's vault. He is in complete control of the situation, even when McClane is causing high rise havoc with everything from automatic weapons to plastic explosives.Rickman never loses his cool, and gets a lot of great lines. He even finds time to mock McClane, likening him to a cowboy. This is where McClane's famous catchphrase comes from Yippie Kayee Mother F###er. I like the way Rickman has the police (and later the FBI) at a complete disadvantage, bluffing his way past them about comrades in arms to keep them occupied. He simply weaves them into his plan, and he skillfully manipulates them to play right into his hands. This is a rare thing in an action film, where neither hero, nor villain upstages the other.Reginald VelJohnson is also great as Sgt Al Powell, the only ally McClane has with the cops on the outside. Although they talk via radio, the two have great chemistry, and I like the scene when Al confides in McClane how he accidentally shot a kid, even though they've never met. This illustrates the bond between them. McClane returns the favour when asking Al if he could tell Holly he's sorry their marriage didn't work out. This shows his more sensitive side, but I think it shows depth to McClane's character, and doesn't come across as soppy. That's why he's such a great hero.The stunts are incredible, in particular when McClane has to jump off the roof tied to a fire hose. I like the way he says just before he's about to jump \"Oh God, please don't let me die\", compared to some other action heroes like Schwarznegger or Stallone who would probably just jump. This again demonstrates what a realistic character he is playing.Nailbiting stuntwork and spectacular pyrotechnics are impressive, and never overshadow the characterisation built upon throughout the film. The action scenes serve the plot, when in most action films, it is the other way around. There are some people who won't like the swearing (and even I found some of it unnecessary) but the film is still a masterpiece of action. Definitely John McTiernan's best film (although Predator was almost on a par) and its so stylish and witty right up to the nailbiting conclusion.Die Hard even succeeds as a knowing commentary on the action film genre, dropping references to other action heroes, and exemplifies Bruce Willis as a new type of hero. One that can get hurt, one that feels pain, and one that actually has ties to the world.The best of the Die Hard series, and I love the Christmas song Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow on the end credits to remind you it is still Christmas even after all this. Not to mention how liberating it is to watch a corporate building going up in flames.Die Hard set a whole new standard for action films to come. There have been many imitations since, but none have ever managed to top the unforgettable adventure of Die Hard."

                "content": "Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman."

                "content": "Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth."

Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!"

It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece."

But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia."

The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic."

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought.

It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see."

I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men.

The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings."

                "content": "I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product."

Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out."

The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again.

But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.\"The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?"

Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie."

The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!"

It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell."

It is a mix of exactly the book, and not the book at all. The atmosphere is dark, the action is excellent, I was never bored. It is easy to follow even if you don't know French history, but it is not dumbed down either.The cast (as per real history and the novel) is FANTASTIC. The story is modernised and completely over the top which corresponds totally to the spirit of Dumas, if not to the actual book (it was way over the top for its time as well) .You come out of there like you did as a child after watching a swashbuckling movie with Errol Flynn.My brother cheered loudly like a child, a girl in the audience was crying, all in all, a roaring success in the vein of the very old action movies, but completely modernised with a certain dark steampunk flair.Highly highly recommend. Especially with a good screen and sound which are worth it."

You feel the gravitas and heaviness of the situation, while also following our different protagonists that all bring this tasty feeling of adventure and historical fresco ; it is filled with a clever humor, powerful and intense dramatic scenes, dillemas ; espionage, conspiracies and manipulation that punctuate the story and give the film its thickness & richness ; but there also is a cute little romance that brings a sweet levity to the piece.All of this is majestically served by a plethoric cast, the cream of French acting. They all fit their characters perfectly, and every character offers rich layers and fills certain specific archetypes useful each in the part they play for the overarching storyline... There is this greater \"scheme\" and at its heart there is this \"hero journey\"...A storyline that's convoluted while being easy to read and process, because well built through the various steps of the evolution of the narrative.The entire piece is beautifully staged (certain action bits might look a lil muddled/shaky here and there, but everything is prettily choreographed all along)... The grain of the image, its texture, the use of light, the textures, and the close-ups ; it all highlights the actors' performance and pleasantly contributes to our immersion into the various intrigues and themes of the story...A last mention and praise to the music score, which is grandiose and perfectly orchestrated ; often epic, silky at times, and simply subtle when needed... Superb composition.Overall, the quality of all the ingredients as well as the final product are excellent, and the great production value is the cherry on top of the cake.A very good movie which won't leave you indifferent and will probably be remembered beautifully.Great work of art."

From what i hear from the director of the movie they took the story, the dialogues as it was in the book but added some stuff and some story that it wasnt in the book. I appreciated it because i still think that if the movie was like the book it will be really boring and uninteresting to see the same thing and add some interest to see it. I enjoyed to see Eva Green, Louis Garrel and Vincent Cassel that i find the performance quite different and interesting to be honest. We see them in other ways that we were used to see them. I enjoyed the story: it have some revelation, surprises, dramatic, love, comedy moments that i really enjoyed and find it interesting to see. It was the part 1 and the end let us want to know what will happen next: about D'Artagnan? Constance(what she saw? And who she saw that we couldnt see?). The fights sequences was quite interesting and the long sequences that we have without a cut reinforced the immersion to live in real time what the characters go trough. I find Eva Green beautiful to be honest and was pretty sensual and good looking on screen. Im waiting for part 2 to see more and im pretty impatient to see that soon."

I have been watching various adaptations for years hoping one of them will finally get it right. I was particularly hopeful about this one - I thought if anyone can do it justice it should be the French.For an adaptation of classic novel to be good it must be faithful to the original source material and not make unnecessary alterations to the plot.It must also adequately capture the atmosphere of the time period, the main theme and the essence of the book - which to me was honor, loyalty and friendship.Another very important requirement is proper character development. And for that to truly work the actors should look like the characters as described in the book and be approximately the same age (or at least look that age).In terms of casting - I'd give this adaptation a 3/10.I know Vincent Casel is a good actor but he is 57 years old!!! He could have played another character. Why did they cast him as Athos? Athos is supposed to be 27-29 and very handsome (I know this is highly subjective but still).The actor playing Aramis is also 50 when he should be 22-23. He is not attractive or charming either and Aramis is supposed to be the best looking one of the bunch (at least most other adaptations get this right).For some reason everyone loves Eva Green - she maybe great in other movies but I don't like her as Milady at all. Milady is supposed to be intoxicatingly beautiful and blonde. This actress has jet black hair and is rather plain looking. I have no idea why the director made her smoke a pipe - this just makes her look like a cartoon villain.They also made Porthos bisexual. Think of that what you will - I personally find if ridiculous.If that wasn't enough to disappoint all hard core fans of the book - the plot has been drastically changed.It's annoying because they have kept some parts very close to the book and created this illusion of authenticity. The cinematography is cool looking and the setting has a realistic feel. I like that it is not a slapstick comedy like some of the other adaptation attempts. That being said - the camera angles are a bit weird. They put you in the middle of the duels so you can't get a good feel of what's happening. And the editing is very choppy.Overall I don't regret watching this film but I can't say that I liked it.I guess I'll have to wait another 3-5 years until someone attempts to adapt this book again - maybe they will finally get it right."

The interpretation of the novel is very independent, which is certainly the right approach given the abundance of film adaptations already available. And it is European cinema!

                "content": "Although The Three Musketeers already has too many adaptations, surprisingly this French production offers something that, unlike previous adaptations, sticks quite closely to the novel in many aspects. It is an excellent film in many technical aspects with a wonderful production. It has a good cast and the script offers a much more detailed plot of The Three Musketeers. Athos accused of a crime he did not commit, the hidden romance between Buckingham and Anne, the Protestants, historical elements of the conflict between France and England and a clue about Milady's past are details that greatly help the dynamics of the plot. It is a classic action and adventure story very well executed and adapted to current times. Like the first adaptations, this film only narrates half of the novel and does so in a spectacular way. Les Trois Mousquetaires: D'Artagnan is perhaps the definitive adaptation of Dumas' work and leaves a very good impression with desire to see the rest of the story in the second part. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10."

When Athos is falsely accused of murder, the other trio ensure to save Athos and time, while unraveling the larger conspiracy to harm the King and the Queen as well as instigating wide unrest planned by the baddie Milady and others. How D'Artagnan and three musketeers become a big hurdle to Milady and will they be able to save their King on time forms rest of the story, building up for a sequel.Straight up, this was definitely a good watch and even if the action set pieces mostly with the sword didn't stand out but the story as well as the characters instantly connects. To simply put, the production is top notch. Be with the setting and the costumes, the era is set solidly and the director wastes no time in kickstarting with the action right from the introduction scene of D'Artagnan. It kept throwing enough entertaining scenes throughout, made memorable by the actor especially the multiple duel scene with the trio or even the flirting between the main lead and Constance. It definitely was an easy watch and to keep more of Eva Green to the sequel alone is worth waiting for it."

She's probably the best one to play the part since Faye Dunaway, and I look forward to seeing more of her in the sequel, which is named after her character.Anyway this is a lot of fun you'll care about the characters, and there is a breathtaking cliff edge horse chase.

While D'Artagnan (François Civil) could be forgiven for being dirty seeing as he was buried alive after a skirmish in the opening scenes, Paris itself is dirty and dusty. So are the inhabitants, many, even the well off could do with a wash, the film realistically portrays Paris in springtime 1627. Great fight scenes in forests, within Cathedrals, Abbeys and even at a wedding which makes The Bride's wedding in Kill Bill seem like a quiet affair, Not a buckle is left unswashed. The violence is a lot more realistic and the would be priest Aramis (Romain Duris) isn't above using a sharpened crucifix as a torture instrument to obtain information. This is an adult version of the tale and Porthos (Pio Marmal) turns out to be bisexual. Eva Green is suitably dastardly as Milady, Cardinal Richelieu's (Eric Ruf) agent and assassin. Vincent Cassel is ageing but still a warrior, torn between his loyalty to the King and his Protestant religion, an impressive performance. Actually good performances all round. An enjoyable historical romp. Directed and Co-Written by Martin Bourboulon. 8/10."

Some of France's best acting talent is on display although I think Cassel and Duris are miscast. They don't do it for me. Matters aren't helped by some of the worst subtitles I've ever seen.

Haven't read it since jr high but I can tell you whatever this film is, it's not it.First the cast: the lead playing Dartagnan is horrible. He keeps being referred to as \"a boy\" when he is in fact clearly a middle aged actor. Yes Dartagnan is supposed to be young. Why cast this actor then? Also he really can't act he's supposed to come off as flirty but just comes off as a skeez.Next the action: you literally can't see anything. Any fighting? Let's zoom in as much as possible on the faces or 1 part of the body, lots of blurry camera shots, 5000 cuts per second, you have NO idea what is going on. Have rarely seen action sequences this badly shot.Third the story: who's who? There is zero explanation of anything. If you don't have a context of who these characters already are, if you are not familiar with French history or Dumas' original novel, you'll be lost. There is also no character development. You don't care at all about any of the characters.3:There are numerous contemporary biases that have been inserted into the story that are completely irrelevant to the story.4: Dartagnan's magical horse. So it's the 17th century, a horse is a huge asset. So let me just dump it anywhere, in the middle of the street and abandon it for hours, days and then it will magically re-appear! Later , whenever I need it! (smh)5:did you know that the royal guard, the royal palace and well everywhere and anywhere is as the french say \"like a moulin\" ie you can just waltz in, just about, maybe you need to run a bit but there's zero security and if there is they can't be bothered to look for you if you just run past them...how convenient...when the writing is this bad and you can't be bothered to even try to come up with something that vaguely makes sense....6:what a wasted opportunity. Btw this is chapter 1 of I assume a trilogy. The movie ends on a cliffhanger and the card \"to be continued...\"Don't waste your time, there have been so many filmed versions of the novels for tv or movies. Pick one, any one of them and it will be at worse just as bad or more likely better. Very surprised by the high rating - the movie was terrible."

                "content": "I have been a fan of Alexandre Dumas since childhood and know his musketeer trilogy almost by heart. Naturally, I have been looking forward to the new French (!) screen version of the first book for the last several months, especially as this winter I also watched (and enjoyed) the BBC TV series The Musketeers for the first time and was curious how the two will compare. Otherwise, my ideal screen version is the Russian (Soviet) TV film of 1979, as, despite its general naiveté it captured the spirit of the book: youthful friendships, unconditional loyalty, boundless belief in one's strength, humour and fearlessness. But I am always open to new interpretations of the material.Unfortunately, the new French movie proved to be disappointing for me. Yes, one should give credit where it's due: the iconic locations such as the Louvre, Fontainebleau, Les Invalides, Chantilly will make the heart of any Dumas' fan melt, especially after many low-budget substitutions we saw in other productions. The costumes also deserve nothing but praise: the luxury, the ornaments, multiple layers, abundance of the smallest details, the worn-off effect - even an untrained eye can see how much hard work and skill went into these. The masquerade ball at Duke Buckingham's palace is where this work culminates: I would be ready to rewatch the film just to be able to once again admire the Duke and Milady's costumes as well as those of other guests.And yet, despite all of this splendour, the movie seems to have completely missed the spirit of the book. It happens, however, not because the filmmakers preferred form over substance, but because the script writers happened to be too smart for their own good. Whether to demonstrate their creative potential or to make the movie more exciting for those who remember the source material, they started to gild the lily. As a result, in addition to the original diamonds adventure the film follows an even more complicated plot line: a Protestant conspiracy against the King. Both arcs are filled with insignificant scenes built in in order to keep the viewer entertained (for example, Athos' attempt to frighten d'Artagnan in the woods). As a consequence, the screen time of all key figures is spread thin between many different events, and they barely have time to say and do things required to pack all the plot milestones into the allotted film length, while their characters and relationship to one another remains un(der)developed. Unfortunately, the musketeers themselves are the first to fall victim to this problem. The friendship and true affection binding four very different people, each with a distinct persona of his own, are the cornerstones of the novel. And yet in the movie we hardly see them together at all: multiple events demand that the group splits between different plot lines in order to tick all the plot boxes. Neither do they get a chance to express themselves properly and demonstrate their signature traits we know from the books: Athos' aristocratic attitudes, d'Artagnan's cleverness and shrewdness, Porthos' good nature & vanity, Aramis' finesse and piety. Coupled with the casting choices that made the characters so much older than their prototypes, it makes it even more difficult for the viewer to believe in their friendship, as older people rarely bond as closely as the musketeers did in the novel.Supporting characters find themselves in a similar situation: the omnipotent Cardinal Richelieu only shows up in a few scenes, and his true goals remain unknown. It is never explained why he is an enemy to the Queen: neither unrequited romantic feelings nor political agenda are mentioned (obviously disgracing the Queen is not the only way to start a war with England, if we assume that this is his ultimate goal). Louis XIII is simply badly written, what a waste of Louis Garrel's acting talent: his character doesn't come off as either comical or tragic or as having much intelligence. Vicky Krieps as the Queen is more lucky as she is given at least two dramatic scenes in which to shine and be remembered. Eva Green as Milady is good, but not surprising, for the actress has been playing similar roles for many years. I was somewhat perplexed by the story of her relationship with Athos (as far as it was touched upon in the first installment) being largely borrowed from BBC's The Musketeers, including the role Athos' brother plays in identifying her as a criminal.As I said in the beginning, I think that the lack of character development is a result of the overloaded script and not due to subpar acting. Yes, the film does surprise even those well familiar with the book, but it comes at a very big expense, as none of the characters resonates with the viewer emotionally. One hopes that they will make a better job of it in the second installment to be released in December. In the meantime, given the sumptuous locations and wonderful costumes and the benefit of doubt, I'll give the film 6 starts out of 10."

This new adaptation is rather gritty and dirty. No doubt that the 1600's were not sterilized, but this movie is more like early middle ages than romantic France. Also, maybe the populace lived in dirt and mud, but the King and his guard didn't. The casting of the Musketeers was also rather odd, these guys don't look the part at all, they just seem like regular folk, no charisma or presence. Milady the Winter and Treville are on point.Funny they wanted to preserve or recreate the dirt and grit of war engulfed France of the 1600's but they had to add the 2023 touch to it by making Porthos Bi.

He has all the passion, naivety and pride necessary to play him.Louis Garrel as Louis 13 is simply brilliant with all the stupidity and also strength he give to him. Louis 13 can also saying the most stupid thing but you will always feel that he is the king. One of the best interpetation of the movie.Vicky Krieps is good as always in Queen.Jacob Fortune-Lloyd is really good too as Buckingham.Lyna Khoudri is beautiful as Constance in her romance with D'Artagnan.Eric Ruff in Cardinal Richelieu has an incredible charisma.The movie follow very well the book in some parts and create some storyline in the other side. The fan of the book can be happy for seeing a global script really faithful to the book and also discovering some new parts who are really good (the church scene is one of the best)! The action scene are incredible. They are all in a single shot and with steadicam and drone what is really immersive. They shoot the movie in natural places and many castle in France and the results is fantastic. The costumes are wonderfull as well with a western touch really pleasant.The music of Guillaume Roussel (who learn with Hans zimmer himself) feat very well.Go see this movie you will not be disappointed the second part come on screen the 13 december 2023 !The Writers of the movie are working on a french adaptation of the Comte De Montecristo with french actor Pierre Niney and I can't wait to see this one after their work on this movie !"

                "content": "If the time is given to make a film in several chapters, why make a film that links situations with such speed.The psychology of the characters (fascinating in the work of Dumas) is non-existent, everything is developed in haste to privilege the action. The dialogues are modernized and take away all the panache and the faconde proper to the text of the work and of the time.The film seeks the pleasure of the greatest number of people at the expense of the literary quality of the work.On the side of satisfaction nevertheless, Louis Garrel as Louis XIII, mischievous and charming. Also, the casting of the musketeers, in the physical and for some lines."

                "content": "\"Les trois mousquetaires: D'Artagnan\" is an excellently made film, the cast gives first-rate performances especially François Civil, Vincent Cassel, Romain Duris, Pio Marmaï, Louis Garrel, Eva Green, Vicky Krieps and Lyna Khoudri. The adaptation of the script is sublime, the soundtrack is tremendous, the costume design is superb, and the cinematography is beautiful, managing to be a delight visual. This adaptation of the classic story manages to entertain during its duration and especially for its production, the script offers classic moments and adds others that are new, giving a story full of action and adventure. A film that deserves only praise."

You should never close a lengthy movie with \"to be continued \" especially as it was a crucial scene!"

                "content": "I enjoyed this. Plenty of swash, buckle and enough faith with the original Alexandre Dumas story to give the narrative - and the production - some integrity. \"D'Artagnan\" (an engaging François Civil) arrives in Paris bent on becoming one of the KIng's discredited musketeers. Before his first day is out, though, he has encountered three individuals whose honour requires an early morning meeting with swords drawn. Luckily before they have their opportunities to fill the young man full of holes, \"Athos\" (Vincent Cassel); \"Aramis\" (Romain Duris) and \"Porthos\" (Pio Marmaï) join forces to defeat the men from the Cardinal's guard who inform them that duelling is illegal. That pretty much sets the tone for this enjoyable action-packed adventure. There is a soupçon of romance between our young hero and \"Constance\" (Lyna Khoudri) but that doesn't get much opportunity to clutter up the thread as our four intrepid and loyal soldiers have to try and save the honour of the queen (Vicky Krieps) from the scheming of Cardinal Richelieu (Eric Raf) and his arch-assassin \"Milady\" (Eva Green). Now, as usual, Green is terrible. She exudes precisely no menace and made me wish it could have been Lana Turner reincarnate. Otherwise, though, Martin Bourboulon keeps the pace moving nicely, the scenarios are authentic looking with a great deal of Parisian mud to trudge and fight through before a daring denouement that sets the whole thing up for what I assume is a part two. Simply, it takes skill to screw up a strong story and nobody here manages that - it's a good, old-fashioned, escapade driven story of loyalty and duplicity and for two hours, I lapped it up."

                "content": "The opening scene of this film is one of those that will forever remain in the memory of lovers of the seventh art! Engaging, magnificently made by one of the masters of cinematography (Nicolas Bolduc). The story, known to many, whether through books or cinema, continues to arouse the interest of those who are just looking for fun for a few hours. Safe direction by Martin Bourboulon, facilitated by the stellar cast, whose highlights are Eva Green, Vicent Cassel, Pio Marmaï and surprise: François Civil. Alternating comedy and drama, which only the French know how to do, the relatively long film disconnects us from time and holds our attention until the last scene, which left me perplexed, as I have seen countless films! Sensational! When I realized it, it was already late in the morning... In my opinion, it is a film that should be seen and reviewed. Certainly one of the best releases this year (2023), so poor in premieres, to the point of having to resort to the old films on video cassette that I still have.On a scale of 1 (no comments) to 10 (masterpiece), my vote is 9 (excellent)."

Outfits are great and you do get a good feeling about the time the story is happening.The narrative is a bit broken, they try to go deep in some areas but fail so things remain left like suspended mid air. The main plot is vague and many things happen at the same time, you don't get lost, but it lacks purpose in some way, plus very slow pace it gets boring.I'm not a hard core Dumas fan but I do remember musketeers where young like D' Artagnan and this dude's are old. Didn't bother me but being a book adaptation feels wrong."

                "content": "I have seen all the previous movie versions of Dumas' The Three Musketeers, but this is by far the best of them. It's a much grittier adaptation, although not without the black humour of the book, and is, in my mind, more like the sort of story Dumas was aiming for.I see some reviews complaining about the ages of the principals, but I have always considered Aramis, Athos and Porthos to be a fair bit older than d'Artagnan. How could they mentor him, otherwise? So i think the casting works.It's beautifully lit and shot. The original score is good. The fight scenes are very well done. All in all, it's excellent.I am eagerly awaiting the next instalment!"
