                    "content": "Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timothée Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be \"hip\" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"

                    "content": "On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timothée Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."

They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."

This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timothée Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."

                    "content": "Wonka, the latest film from director Paul King, takes us on a journey into the fantastical world of Willy Wonka's early life. While the film is visually delightful and boasts a strong performance from Timothée Chalamet, its chaotic story and forgettable music leave it feeling bittersweet.Chalamet shines as a young Willy Wonka, brimming with youthful enthusiasm and boundless creativity. His performance is a welcome departure from the more jaded interpretations of the character, injecting a much-needed dose of innocence and wonder. Olivia Colman and Hugh Grant round out the cast with memorable supporting roles, adding humor and depth to the film.The film's greatest strength lies in its visual feast. The vibrant sets and costumes bring the Chocolate Factory to life in all its fantastical glory, creating a truly immersive experience for the audience. King's signature whimsical style shines through, crafting a lighthearted and enjoyable atmosphere that is sure to captivate children and adults alike.However, Wonka's charm is somewhat diminished by its chaotic story. The plot feels convoluted and lacks focus, making it difficult to follow at times. This is further exacerbated by the film's foray into musical territory. While the songs are visually stunning, they are unfortunately plagued by generic melodies and forgettable lyrics. They ultimately feel disconnected from the narrative, serving as unwelcome interruptions rather than emotional enhancements.While not quite reaching the heights of King's Paddington films, Wonka manages to entertain with its whimsical tone and charming performances. Fans of Chalamet and visually stunning musicals will likely find much to enjoy. However, those seeking a more focused and emotionally resonant experience may find themselves left wanting. Overall, Wonka is a visually delightful and whimsical film that ultimately feels like a mixed bag of treats, leaving one with a taste of both satisfaction and disappointment."

                    "content": "Origin stories can be hit (\"Wicked\" the musical) or miss (who even remembers \"Oz the Great and Powerful\"?). On that scale \"Wonka\" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame \"Wonka\". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of \"The French Dispatch\" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe \"Wonka\"."

Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into \"Les Miz\" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out \"Master of the House.\"One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."

That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."

                    "content": "Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies - Movie Review (12/16/23): \"Wonka\". First thing to know is to NOT expect either previous version of the movie related to the character. It's neither Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp's version. It's not about a kid coming to the factory after getting a gold ticket. Nothing like that.. so don't expect it. This is Willy's return after going to Oompa Loompa Land and wanting to start making chocolate. Knowing that will help you by not having wrong expectations. In this case, Willie goes up against a \"gang of three different chocolatiers\" (one is Slugworth).The movie is worth seeing.. and it's a movie event, but be aware that it certainly feels more like a stage play in some respect as the acting is \"big\".. as if exaggerated and animated, as if it's being played TO an audience.Timothee Chalamet does a nice job as Willy Wonka, but he fortunately doesn't have the craziness of Depp's Wonka, but neither quite the warmth or interesting appeal as Wilder's Wonka. Don't expect Wilder or Depp's Wonkas, and that will also help your expectations.Though this isn't a musical, there's a fair bit of music and songs in this new version. Some of the music is a bit campy, but some of the music and songs WILL bring back fond memories of the Gene Wilder version of \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\".I can say that for about the first half of the movie, I really wasn't enjoying this new version of the movie much.. but after about half way through the movie, I started to like and appreciate this movie for what IT is, and not what it isn't (which is like the other two).As I said, do NOT expect the previous other two Wonka movies and look for something completely new. If you go into it and keep a \"clean slate\" image and appreciate it as a brand new movie, I think you'll like it more.Only other note is that Chalamet sings in the movie, and he's not bad, but he's also not as good as an actor like Hugh Jackman (who is an actor who is also an excellent singer.. and other similar actors with well-trained singing voices).The story line is a good one, and the acting is very good by Wonka and the others who are \"in debt\" (you'll understand if/when you see the movie), but the actors portraying the chocolatiers and police are more like the over-acting characters from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (cartoonish in their over-acting). I'd give this movie a 6.2 and say that it's definitely worth seeing.. and seeing on a big screen. I think if the director had taken this movie a little less \"Chitty Chitty-ish\", I would be up in the mid 7 rating... or even a little higher. Go see Wonka at the theater!"

                    "content": "Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That \"edge\" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's \"Pure Imagination,\" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."

We were used on Wonka being a secondary character of Charlie and the golden ticket story.The movie is well crafted but it has serious problems:i) Chalamet is a fantastic actor and has the potential to be one of the great ones of his generation BUT he was a miscast. Im sorry, but i just don´t see him as Wonka.Ii) Part of what makes a musical great is that the songs and numbers are meant to be remarkable and catchy. After almost 80 years, people still sing singin´in the rain yet Wonka has no memorable song or tune except for the Oompa Loompa bit that was taken straight outta the original one.To me, this 2 flaws are terrible and make it a bad Wonka movie and a bad musical but taking those out of the equation, it is actually a good film.Enjoy it with your loved ones,Stay safe and happy holidays."

We were looking forward to see Wonka, but then we were all disappointed.Movies is not bad, it's fairly entertaining, kids liked it, but we all agreed it's nowhere close to Tim Burton's movie. There was huge potential to bring some new magic into the chocolate world of Willy Wonka, but they failed to do that.During the movie, I never once felt the irresistible craving for chocolate, even though I'm a big fan of sweets. That's an unforgivable mistake. In Burton's film, I enjoyed the world of chocolate, from the beginning until the end. Also, the story is very average, focused mainly on the negative aspects of the world we live in. I don't know if they wanted to make a chocolate Oliver Twist, but the combination of the magical world of chocolate and the harsh realism of Charles Dickens just doesn't work together. I'm not dissatisfied with the film, but I am disappointed because it could and should have been much better, more magical, more appealing, and - tastier."

A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes.

Searching for a place to stay, Wonka stumbles upon a laundromat run by the suspicious Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Colman), who offers him a room so long as he signs a contract. After failing to read the fine print, Wonka finds himself in debt to Mrs. Scrubbit and is forced to work around the clock to earn his freedom. While labouring away, Wonka meets five other people who are also indebted to Mrs. Scrubbit's contract; young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), plumber Piper (Natasha Rothwell), accountant Abacus (Jim Carter), phone operator Lottie (Rakhee Thakrar), and comedian Larry (Rich Fulcher). The five prisoners inform Wonka that the city is controlled by the \"Chocolate Cartel\", a trio of greedy chocolate makers - Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mr. Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Mr. Fickelgruber (Mathew Boynton) - who are fiercely determined to eliminate any potential competition. Wonka teams up with his five new friends to hatch a scheme to bring down the cartel and make his chocolate available to everyone no matter their financial situation.One of the most popular children's stories of the twentieth century is Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", the timeless tale of a young boy named Charlie Bucket who is given the opportunity to meet the eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka and visit his mysterious chocolate factory. Since it was first published back in 1964, the story has become a favourite among children the world over, with many like myself growing up reading it at school. Further cementing the story's popularity was the 1971 film adaptation \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" and to a lesser extent Tim Burton's 2005 film \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". Regardless of which of the two films you prefer, their success at the box office proves that the story is as renowned as it ever was, with the character of Willy Wonka attracting the most attention due to his quirky personality. The 2023 film \"Wonka\" gives us an origin story of the title character in a movie that should keep both children and adults entertained for most of the time.Although I'm not entirely sure if we needed to know about the origins of Willy Wonka, this film shows just barely enough about him to still retain that necessary air of mystery without completely ruining his character. When we first meet the young Wonka, he is shown to be ambitious about opening a chocolate shop, singing his passion for the sweet treat loudly from high atop a ship's mast. Upon arriving at his destination, Wonka learns to his dismay that this place is dreary, depressing, and has little time for fun-loving individuals like himself. In fact, no less than three minutes later, Wonka is even forced to pay a fine for daydreaming out in public. Things take a turn for the worst when Wonka is essentially forced into slavery to pay off a huge debt due to his inability to read a contract's fine print as a result of his illiteracy.In spite of all his hardships, Wonka's spirit remains untarnished as he is determined to share his wondrous treats with the world, no matter who or what stands in his way. What I enjoyed here was how the film was able to balance Wonka's confident oddball personality with that of him being the underdog in a new town, staying true to himself but still acknowledging the uphill battle he has to succeed in this harsh world. This is an important message that people of all ages can learn from, since becoming successful is not always an easy task and doing so without sacrificing your own integrity is a challenge within itself. As a result, the otherwise off-putting Willy Wonka becomes a relatable character the audience can find themselves identifying with.Being a musical, there are numerous moments in the film where characters break into song whenever it is necessary for them to communicate their inner monologues. While the songs were all fine and served their intended purpose, I found that most of them weren't all that memorable. The one original musical number I liked the most was near the beginning, where Wonka learns about the fates of his five co-workers/prisoners and how they are doomed to \"Scrub Scrub\" until all their debts are paid. The reason I enjoyed this the most was because it is done in the most Roald Dahl way possible, complete with word play, dark humour, and crackpot villains.Additionally, there are also some variations on the classic tunes from the 1971 film. For instance, the \"Oompa Loompa\" song makes not one but two appearances here, sung by an Oompa Loompa named Lofty (Hugh Grant). Instead of singing about misbehaving children, Lofty sings about why he is no longer welcome among his peers, which is both sad and funny once you learn the actual reason. The older viewers might appreciate the callbacks to the original \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" film and I'm certain the younger viewers will like the newer songs, but I can't really see any of them getting stuck in people's heads once the movie has finished.As the title character, I liked the youthful spin Timothée Chalamet was able to add to an already exceptionally outlandish individual. His take on Willy Wonka is that of an experienced young man who seems ready to take on the world, only to find that not everyone is there to support him in his endeavours. Chalamet's Wonka seems to be unique among his predecessors in that he does not seem to be the younger version of either one, although he does show some of the condescending traits of Gene Wilder's version and the melancholic insecurities of Johnny Depp's version. This almost seems like a compromise of sorts, as though the filmmakers tried to combine both Wilder's and Depp's Wonkas into one so as not to alienate the fans too much. I would say this does work for the most part, however, I personally think they should have just picked one and gone with that instead.Most of the supporting cast were quite good, especially Wonka's five co-workers turned friends who assist him on his mission. With that in mind, Noodle is clearly the main one out of the five that receives the most attention in the story. Although I did like the idea of her being Wonka's street smart friend, I think there was one important thing about her character that is never explained. Early in the film, we learn that Wonka is illiterate, struggling to comprehend even single letters of the alphabet, which is where Noodle comes in to teach him how to read. Being an orphan who never went to school, how did Noodle become intelligent enough to be able to educate a grown man on the basics of reading and writing? We never find out how she acquired this level of education, so this seems like a major plot hole the movie glosses over. I'm not sure if this is the film's way of saying children are sometimes smarter than adults, but it would have been nice to have been provided some explanation as to how an orphan raised on the streets is capable of teaching an adult man comprehensive English skills.I thought the three main villains were rather amusing at times, but Mr. Slugworth is clearly the leader of the trio. Slugworth is shown to be the brains of this whole operation, which is established by the firm, aggressive handshake he gives to everyone he meets. This film treats him and his two colleagues as though they are running some kind of narcotics ring, only with chocolate instead of drugs. I suppose this would make Slugworth the Gus Fring of chocolatiering, which is made evident by his widespread infamy over the entire town. On that note, I just wish we could have seen more of Mr. Prodnose's and Mr. Fickelgruber's intimidating influence throughout the story. It just seems like all of Matt Lucas's and Mathew Baynton's comedic talents are going to waste here, as their characters serve little purpose other than to agree with everything Slugworth says.Though far from essential viewing, \"Wonka\" still serves its purpose as an enjoyable origin story of the most famous fictional chocolate maker in all of children's literature. It may not instil the same level of wonder as the other two feature films before it, but it provides just enough entertainment for a casual viewing with the whole family. Had the film placed more focus on developing its supporting cast and fixing some plot holes, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Still, you could definitely do a whole lot worse than what we got so all I can say is just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.I rate it 7/10."

                    "content": "It's a decent origin story about the character of Willy Wonka with good performances, beautiful production, musical tracks, and some good humor. Director Paul King, known for his works on Paddington 1 and 2, does a solid role in handling the setting and themes. The production, color presentations, and the sound designs are great with some good visuals effects and style. All the performances are pretty good as Timothée Chalamet, Calah Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Grant and the rest of the cast members are all fun to observe. Rowan Atkinson is always a blast to see.The narrative is standard and King does try to provide some new interesting elements and style to the story and characters and there are some concepts that worked and some that could have been better. On the humor and singing, there are some good singing moments from the cast members and the humor was solid, although some humorous moments felt flat. The character of Willy Wonka is fun to observe but the other characters weren't really that investing or emotionally engaging to connect with. Some dialogue moments could be better.While it's not amazing, the pacing was good and I was still invested to see where the movie was heading. Overall, it's definitely not the best movie from Paul King but it's still entertaining with fun visuals and a good time to watch for the Christmas Season. Now time to eat some chocolate."

With the most unique recipes, he quickly establishes himself as the best chocolate maker which irks the trio of the chocolate cartel. They want him gone in order to have their monopoly. How Wonka finds his unlikely family in London, who support him to make his dream turn into reality as well as take on the trio of villains forms rest of the story.This musical aims to establish this as a sweet film right with Wonka's introduction in the opening credits and it succeeds in that. Atleast 3 songs stood out and the back story to Noodles provide the much needed drama. There is also Wonka's bonding with his own mother. The songs compliment these emotions as well as the wacky ambition of the young chocolate maker. With the likes of Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Keegan-Michael Key in the supporting cast, makes it even easier in keeping the entertainment intact.The humor worked for me throughout and Timothee Chalamet brought some freshness with his take on the titular character. Calah Lane as Noodles was another standout character. The songs keep entertaining and so does the comedy scenes followed enough dose of drama without dragging the story. Ofcourse adult Wonka turned out to be quiet different and this film doesn't try to reveal anything about that, presenting Wonka as this sweetest boy learning to value relationship and succeeding in his dream to open a chocolate shop. It's a screenplay of convenience and there isn't much to complain."

                    "content": "Ah, the bittersweet symphony of \"Rebel Moon.\" I hear you there, fellow traveler to Pandora and Tatooine. We can both appreciate Zack Snyder's stylistic flourishes - the slow-mo ballet of violence, the operatic landscapes, the characters carved from myth. But as the curtain falls on \"Part One,\" a mournful sigh escapes. This could have been a glorious space opera, a love letter to sci-fi's golden age, yet it stumbles over familiar tropes and squanders its vast potential.Snyder's fingerprints are all over the screen. The visuals are undeniable - gargantuan spaceships casting ominous shadows, crimson blades carving through darkness, desert vistas whispering forgotten empires. He paints with a grand brush, but the canvas starts to feel repetitive. We've seen the grizzled warrior with a troubled past, the damsel in distress with hidden fire, the villain who chews scenery like it's his birthright. It's a well-worn costume rack, and while Snyder drapes it with his signature flair, the threads of originality begin to fray.The plot, a familiar melody of rebellion against tyranny, starts strong but loses its harmonic richness. Characters, instead of complex chords, become predictable arpeggios. Their motivations are thinly veiled, their backstories a rushed montage. The dialogue, meant to resonate like thunder, echoes with the hollowness of recycled sci-fi cliches.What hurts most is the unrealized potential. The glimpses of a deeper world, the whispers of ancient powers, the seeds of a nuanced conflict - all wither in the harsh glare of action sequences. Snyder loves his spectacle, and \"Rebel Moon\" is awash in it, but spectacle alone can't sustain a film. We crave emotion, depth, resonance. We want to be swept away, not merely bombarded.So, as the credits roll, a bittersweet symphony resonates. We acknowledge the maestro's talent, the flashes of brilliance, the echoes of what could have been. But the lingering taste is one of missed notes, of potential left unrealized. \"Rebel Moon\" is a spectacle, no doubt, but a hollow one, leaving us yearning for the sci-fi opera that might have been."

                    "content": "The Zack Snyder fanboy cult is legion. That's fine. Every crowd likes their own kind of music.Objectively this is what Snyder produces: gritty, dark, unhappy, overly serious, tedious stuff. Most of it's average, with a few exceptions. But there's always cool stuff to look at. He's kind of a poor man's Villaneuve.The rabid followers can say what they want about \"The Snyder Cut\" Justice League, but the reality is there's no broad market for unrelentingly dismal sludge. Why isn't there a Judge Dredd movie coming out soon? Or another Punisher film? Dark and too serious isn't fun to spend money on. Especially when it's not all that new.I do have to laugh though, at all the media hacks that are pissing and moaning about how derivative this is. And it is. But it mostly feels that way because Snyder wrote a script for a stand alone Star Wars story and was told by Lucasfilm (or maybe it was Disney) \"thanks, but no thanks\".So he went to the streaming giant that loves to produce expensive projects so they can cancel them before they can develop any traction. This is that script brought to life. Or death, as Netflix may have it.It's not nice to hammer on creatives. But I for one am sick and tired of the waif-ish 90 pound girl warrior movies that have been all the rage lately. And while Boutella (Kora, the protagonist in Rebel Moon) was excellent as Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond, I'm over it. Other than Gunpowder Milkshake (which was hilarious) it's all a bunch of BS. I don't care if Maggie Q or Daisy Ridley (both decent actresses btw) are in it or not (they aren't in this, in case you're confused), it's stupid. It was bad enough when Arnold, Sly and Bruce were ignoring the laws of physics in their various franchises, but we're all a little more savvy now and wouldn't buy that stuff from them in today's market either. But maybe I'm wrong, because there are now 4 Expendables movies in existence. God save us from the people who are buying tickets to those.It's free to subscribers next week, so have at it. Can't wait to see those reviews pour in."

It's not Star Wars, but more Flash Gordon (1980) without the cheese in visual style.The plot is pretty simple following the template of Seven Samurai, but suffers from too much world building exposition. They say \"it's much better to show than tell\", but Rebel Moon counter acts that statement. Sometimes a single sentence will do. Look at Star Wars as an example. George Lucas didn't have the money to do tons of flashback sequences and used dialague, which was just as good or even better leaving it up to the audience's imagination. We didn't need a 10 minute sequence for Kora. That time could have been used to develop the other characters, who are sorely lacking in depth.I know that Snyder loves to use slow motion to highlight moments, but he went a bit overboard with some shots. It was used where it really wasn't needed in some stituations.Overall the movie is good, but it's very hard to digest in one viewing. It's like Underworld where it takes 2-3 times to absorb it all. If anything I'm looking forward to the longer R rated version."

This was going to be a Star Wars film, but happened and what is happing at Lucasfilm, it did not work out, so now Netflix have it, in cinemas now, then on TV.Do try and catch it in the cinemas, as it was filmed for it and you will miss plenty if you don't. Sofia Boutella, takes the lead, and is good at it, getting into all sorts of trouble and looks. Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam, and the great cast mix it up well, floating along the weird and wonderful universe that the film is set in. A great deal of alien creatures, the locations of the different worlds, meeting all these good and bad people, mostly bad, with lots and lots of travelling.

Sofia Boutella as Kora - Her Performance and Screen Presence was Strong Enough to lead this Film. I liked her Backstory, it was Interesting. On top of that, She looks good for the Role, Gorgeous Fit Body and Beautiful Face 💕🤠2. Ed Skrein as Atticus Noble - I feel he Nailed his Role as a Menacing Admiral with no Remorse.👱3. Stella Grace Fitzgerald as Princess Issa - She's interesting, more so in what a Pivotal Role she Could Potentially Play in the Future of Motherworld.🎂 Themes - I liked a couple of the Themes in this film.💘1. The Theme of the Motherworld Losing the Spirit of Compassion.👱2. The Theme of Princess Issa being the One To Reignite that Lost Compassion and Drive the Motherworld into a New Hope. A New Future.🎨💐Visuals - Some of the Visuals were Eye Gazing. Tons of Gorgeous Shots. That Opening Shot was Beautiful. The Huge Scale Galactic Landscapes are Stunning to See at times. That Scene when they are Riding the Elevator downwards at the Lightsaber Womans Planet was a Breathtaking Shot. What a Stunning Shot. 😮⌛Slow Motion - Some of the Slow Motion Battles were a Treat to Watch. That First Slow Motion Battle when the Young Girl is Being Captured was Pretty Good. Sofia Boutellas movements and Manoeuvres and her hair swaying around as she attacks each guy in that Scene were Great to See.🎵 Neutral Note - The Score was Ok, it wasn't Bad.That's where the Positives Stop. 🚫Negatives -📜 1. The Script - Who is Checking and Greenlighting these Scripts? Are they Writing and Reading these Scripts Thoroughly? And When they are Writing these Scripts, are they Concentrating Whilst Reading and Writing these Scripts? There's not Enough Meaningful Dialogue between Characters and there's No Development of Almost Anything. Good Lord🙋2a. All these other Characters - Charlie Hunnam, Tarak (Still looks promising to be fair), The Farmer Guy, Djimon Hounsou, Lightsaber Woman, BloodAxe & Bloodaxes' Sister(both looked and sounded promising and then completely wasted), Robot Dude. 🤖🤦🏻 2b. All those characters I just listed were either completely Underwritten or Useless. They might as well of been 2D Cardboard Cutouts.🌆 3. Where's the World-Building? We visit too many damn Places when we could of Explored a Few of the Places(Especially that place that the Lightsaber Woman was from, Some Stunning Shots there) and got to know more about this particular world and what the view is from them about the Imperium Situation. The Story about the Royal Family of the Motherworld, I wanna see more of that, I wanna see the Scale of Imperiums influence Across the Galaxy. Do others See them as Great because of the Love they once conveyed? Or are Others mounting up attacks and Revolts against them just like Bloodaxe?🤷 Overall, Rebel Moon Part 1 was a Great Opportunity to Build, Build, Build, this Fantastic World and have some Very Good Characters and Storytelling, as I said, there are some Great themes here. Let's Hope that Rebel Moon Part 2 Strengthens and Hones these Elements and really Gets things Going."

Rebel Moon is definitely good enough, I had extremely high expectations, and it did not meet all of them, and it is a VERY different movie from what I was expecting and in some ways that's very good but in some other ways its not as good. I definitely think the story, settings, visuals, plots, side plots, performances, & characters are all fantastic. Where I think the movie could have benefitted more was if more of its limited runtime was spent with the character interactions and just how they get along with each other. It almost feels as though we are in a similar situation to when Batman V Superman came out and we only had part of a movie, but this time I feel it more with this specific one. All in all, it's worth a try, has enough huge enjoyable moments that balances the bad with it and has huge potential. Looking forward to the directors cut that hopefully fixes these issues."

Its an amalgamation of STAR WARS, Star Trek, Farscape, District 9, Alien, Dune, Firefly/Serenity, and The 5th Element all shoe horned into one movie. There's tons of character development missing as the team assembles throughout the film, although I assume this is included in an extended cut, because of course there is another cut adding 30 minutes of additional footage. Maybe that cut will throw out an original idea.If you're a fan of Zack Snyder's other works you'll undoubtedly like this one.

He's looking for redemption in big projects after facing tough years and scorn at his old home.The project was born over 20 years ago, even before Snyder could imagine that he would become one of the greatest directors of today. His films, like \"Dawn of the Dead\", \"Watchmen\", \"300\", \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman vs Superman\", are still debated and admired by the public.In \"Rebel Moon\", we see the director at the peak of his creativity, creating a stunning new fantasy world, full of elements that captivate the public's gaze. This project, however, almost had another fate. Zack Snyder presented his idea to Lucasfilm before it was sold to Disney, but he didn't make it and ended up putting it in the drawer. I think this was one of the best things that happened, as he was able to gain more experience as a filmmaker and consequently enrich his new universe even more. And yes, the film draws inspiration from the same sources that led George Lucas to create \"Star Wars\". I see this as a good thing, not a bad one.The film shows everything we already know about the director: epic scenes, as every good film should have, and that Snyder knows how to do well. The fight scenes are as good as those in \"Batman vs Superman\", where the choreography team did a fantastic job. The story is well tied up, unlike what many haters say. The film doesn't suffer from part 1 syndrome and, just like \"Dune\", it's a great start to a universe, the actors are impeccable in their roles. This makes the film go by very quickly and holds the viewer's attention from beginning to end. The development of the main characters' story is very good.The execution quality of this film is something to admire. The director managed to not only make something extremely cheap, but also with an impressive special effects quality. Amid so many bad projects with exorbitant budgets, Snyder works a miracle in \"Rebel Moon\". No wonder, the film is on the list of the 20 best in special effects at the Oscars.I had the enormous pleasure of being one of the lucky ones who watched this masterpiece at the early release on December 1st at CCXP 23. I was in the front row and I could see something that will be marked: an auditorium of 3000 people cheering and applauding this film on their feet.

Just to pick the most obvious.I originally put this at the end but I'll put it here instead because I think it's important. *** In rebel moon the imperium is explicitly pathetic and uncool in their cruelty and some people will struggle with that.The current big budget ecosystem wans to give us an enemy that is faceless or if not faceless then cool or at least redemeable.Rebel moon offers the imperium none of these. The imperium soldiers aren't given to us a faceless enemy, canon fodder. They're are just as human as us, with names, personalities and even small acts of mercy when they want and all the worse for it. Cruel, bitter and pathetic, they are owed and offered no redemption by their victims or the story. That is the strongest political statement a contemporary film can make about the nature of empire. Some will resent this. ***The development of our lead Kora is brilliantly done, she balances bad assery with vulnerability. Her skill are earned without exaggeration and her history has pathos without being maudlin. And she also saves her gentleman in distress while defending his honor ofc.The world of rebel moon is the real secondary lead in this film. The planets and cultures we glimpse are beautifully rendered and steeped in history and I love that we see evidence of worlds that have evolved independent of each other. The set design is *chefs kiss*, the costume design detailed, well thought out with history's as detailed as the worlds they occupy.Loved the performances with Donna Bae and Charlie Hunnam being easy standouts for all they were secondary characters. Skein as Attics Nobel our villain is sinister from the start and Hopkins work with Jimmy together with the vfx team offers one of the most sympathetic performances. In fact the vfx and makeup team did a phenomenal job. Every ship had weight, felt massive and every creature felt real. I came out falling in love with a cinematic world in a way I haven't experienced since Valerian.If you've played final fantasy, kingdom hearts, star ocean, any big scifi jrpg you'll understand the building a party format that the rebel moon plot follows, from the initiating event to the final boss battle.The big critique is that the party members aren't well fleshed out this is true but it is still very much part 1 as it says in the title so I'm not sure this is fair, it's Assessing the first 2 hirs of what is effectively a 4 hr film at minimum 6hrs extended. The more valid is the choppy pacing in the 2nd act, here the pg 13 edits made from the directors cut for a mainstream audience are more obvious and can be distracting. If I came away with one big critique is that there are parts missing and more than once felt like they were missing. I don't know that I rate the strategy of not releasing the r rated directors cut alongside the pg-13 one and no, I don't have a huge amount of faith in the Netflix release strategy department.But, did I enjoy it? Absolutely. I love scifi, love heavy metal, and most of all I love art that has a strong identity. Rebel moon knows what it is, its a self serious, grounded, large scale adventure and is all the more wonderful for it. 10/10."

Rebel Moon has a dreamy retro-esque/80s feel to it thanks to Snyder's unique visual style which does allow more freedom for the VFX effects. The lense effect he has created works really well for this movie and gives us some truly incredible shots.For a budget of $80M, I thought part 1 looked incredible. The worlds we visit are beautiful, they look lived in and are populated by many unique & exotic aliens. I'm really excited to see how Snyder will expand on this in the extended cut and Part 2.I'm so happy for Sofia Boutella for her first leading role, she absolutely nailed this, she is Kora and Kora is a badass!! The cast is great, they have fantastic chemistry together. But again, I just can't wait to watch the extended cut to delve deeper into these characters, to spend more time with them and discover more about who they are.The violence was impactful, the fight scenes were awesome and the slowmotion was a welcome Snyder touch. The score was absolutely incredible, Tom Holkenborg is on fire again! The technology in this universe is something really special, it went beyond my expectations! I did think RM could have been 20 minutes longer though, just to let some scenes breathe a little and maybe extend some others.The elephant in the room... Star Wars. Tbh I'm so glad this movie isn't a Star Wars story, Rebel Moon is it's own thing and it is carving it's own path. I love the influence Star Wars has had on it but it's no more than the influence of Seven Samurai & Heavy Metal and when the R Rated cut drops it will increase the divide from SW even further.Overall Rebel Moon: Part 1: A Child Of Fire is a fantastic entry into a brand new franchise with a rich universe full of interesting characters and deep lore that I am excited to explored further. Snyder has created something truly unique here and I can't wait to see what more Rebel Moon has to offer."

There is nothing to hate about the film.Was it like Star Wars?I don't think so. I didn't see enough of a similarity. To be honest, I wanted more. So maybe Part 2 will be more Star Wars-esqWhat about the action?I expected more but there was enough to be satisfying.Will you like it?That is ultimately a question u have to ask yourself. But I suggest removing everything you think you know about the film & go in with no expectations. Ppl have described it as Dune or Star Wars/something else. But I personally didn't get those vibes."

This gave me a unique perspective to appreciate the depth and nuances of Zack Snyder's latest creation. Junkie XL's (Tom Holkenborg) score elevated the narrative to epic proportions. Snyder's use of slow motion, a signature element of his directorial style, adds a dramatic flair to the action scenes, though at times it can slightly overshadow the storyline's momentum. The compact 2-hour cut of the film is a tantalizing glimpse into what the extended R-rated version, coming this summer, promises to unfold. A significant aspect of \"Rebel Moon\" is its divergence from the often-made Star Wars comparisons. While there are elements that may feel familiar to fans of the space opera genre, \"Rebel Moon\" establishes its own mythology and world-building. The universe created by Snyder is not just an imitation; it's a unique, self-contained cosmos with its own lore and rules. The influence of \"Heavy Metal\", \"Excalibur\", and anime adds layers to the visual storytelling, making it a rich, textured cinematic experience. Sofia Boutella shines as Kora, bringing a magnetic presence to the screen. Ray Fisher's portrayal of Darrien Bloodaxe and Ed Skrein's embodiment of the Admiral are performances that resonate long after the film ends. The ensemble cast synergizes to bring this imaginative universe to life, each adding a distinct flavor to the narrative's tapestry. The anticipation for the extended R-rated cut, releasing this summer, is high, promising an even more detailed exploration of this rich universe. The film is a testament to Snyder's visionary filmmaking, distinguished by its unique aesthetic, compelling performances, and a score that resonates with epic grandeur. It's more than a sci-fi film; it's a bold new chapter in the genre, promising to captivate audiences with its originality and depth."

Her portrayal of the character was nothing short of badass. She brought such depth and intensity to the role, and I was completely captivated by her on-screen presence.The score in \"Rebel Moon\" was so powerful and really added to the emotional impact of the movie. It's a shame that the film had to be cut down by Netflix. I'm really looking forward to seeing the director's cut when it comes out.

The film is a gorgeous visual masterpiece and it has some amazing performances from lots of the cast and it's nice to finally see Ray Fisher in another film and he does an awesome job here. Kora gives an absolutely breathtaking performance and I thought she was great I do wish there were things in the the film that were different but I can't say it without giving spoilers.

This one is for us! The characters on screen? They are us.Second audience? General. This has broad appeal.

Director Takashi Yamazaki's Herculean efforts of reviving the Kaiju franchise is effortlessly awesome and absolutely top-tier filmmaking with the origin story of the gigantic monster showing up off the shores of post WWII Japan as it engages a full-tilt invasion of Tokyo and its environs with atypical destruction and death. Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic).

Holy heaven, I was so surprised by GODZILLA MINUS ONE. In a year where both of my most anticipated movies turned out to be crummy disappointments (BARBIE and NAPOLEON), this movie-- a film I had no initial plans of seeing and had little enthusiasm for going into it-- blew me away.Godzilla is actually terrifying in this. The post-WWII setting was well-realized, with the characters exhausted after years of violence, destruction, and struggle. The characters were all relatable and interesting-- unlike other Godzilla movies I've seen, I cared intensely about their fates and was emotionally invested in the little found family they formed. And thank God for the lack of ironic jokes undercutting emotional scenes-- after so many trash Hollywood movies, I didn't even know it was possible for a blockbuster to be sincere like this anymore.Most of all, I love how life-affirming this film is. The cautious but persistent optimism is such a breath of fresh air. About my only criticism is that the ending twist is a little hokey... but to be honest, I can forgive that. The movie is too good for me to complain about a happy ending."

The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That's the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don't want to say too much, it's best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren't perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5My current Godzilla rankings:1) Gojira (1954) 2) Godzilla Minus One (2023) 3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995) 4) Shin Godzilla (2016) 5) Return of Godzilla (1984)Special mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)"

Special effects are superior and well presented.The film sucks you into a vortex of history, monsters, and surprisingly restores your faith in humanity.

I'd honestly recommend this movie even if you're not a Godzilla fan. It is seriously that good. The humans were great in this movie. You really felt for them and can see how they got to their mindset. The effects were really good. It really looks like a guy is in a rubber suit, just like the good old days, but it is entirely CGI and with it being done on just a budget of 15 million dollars. There is no excuse for a 250 million dollar movie to look terrible when this movie made everything work with 15 times less of a budget.

If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release."

Kind of ruined the meaning of the death for the main character and emotion part (as the title \"Minus One\" can have a meaning for Japan overall AND specificaly the main hero).The idea to set the story in the 40's Japan is also interesting, as a foreigner i really discovered this post-war period of the country that i didn't really know about (i only saw Kurosawa's \"Subarashiki nichiyobi\" prior to this movie).The actions sequences are also very cool. You definitively won't be disapointed with them.

And I really enjoyed this gradual evolution of plot and character development.-The evolution of handling Godzilla felt like Jaws almost, gradually pushing to an epic finale that feels climactic and in character with the film.The Writing: -It's not the most unique or amazing writing, but again, it's real, raw, and fitting for the tone of the movie.-Minus One has lines that really match the expectations of post-war Japan, moving alongside the main character's part in life and gradually matching it to feel approachable and believable.-There was natural comedy built in to liven things up, mixed well with more dramatic writing that matches the dramas on Netflix and other streaming platforms.-And to even give that science fiction feeling as well, but never getting lost into what feels like a theoretical physics book, aces in my books for making things moving well.The Pacing: -There are slow parts to this film, but they are fewer than I anticipated, only getting lost in the sullen times to help with building up the next act.-Instead, the movie surprisingly works in how it again builds up the characters around the big monster, pitting man vs. Beast in another battle for survival.-Despite being heavily centered on human, Minus One is a plus on just how well it keeps things moving, with most of the 125 minute run time flying by for me well.-Moving fast enough to balance characters and monster time to give enough of both, and yet not so fast that all this attempts at character development have been a waste.The Acting: -It's good in regards to the feel of the movie for me, somehow delivering strong lines despite me not understanding a lick of Japanese.-Kamiki's acting is solid, feeling one part real-life anime meets epic monster performance. He's got his emotions under control for the most part, though the crying is a little forced and fake sounding. Still, facial expressions and character acting are solid, good details to help show the burden on his mind and make me resonate with his struggles.-Ando is fine for the time she is on screen. Her opening acts are stellar for delivering those key line moments, but she doesn't get enough screen time to really maximize the full motion I think she could have brought.-Hamabe on the other hand has plenty of time, and she was probably the best of the bunch in terms of elegant balance, beautiful delivery with poetic phrasing, and just a touch of emotional explosion when needed. Such a great dynamic she established with just about every character.Godzilla: -The beast is a design to pay tribute to the original beast that got this all started. His movement, frame, and face are all sculpted to the classic rubber suit and a fan like me loved it.-The modern day graphics help add better texture, fluid movement, and some added features to help give him that deadlier edge we've grown accustomed to.-His movement has organic anatomy to it, but on land that classic gait of being sort of bloated and hindered worked amazingly for me and again a nice little nod to the fanbase.-And when action emerges, it's got that feeling of classic monster movie moments, but again having that edge of modern cinema to bring you into the movement. The way Godzilla reels to damage, the way he moves to maximize damage, and even the water moments are epic in that Jaws like manner.-throw in some other tricks that CGI makes easier to achieve, and the Godzilla really does have a few more tricks that this \"realistic\" approach did well.The Action: -Is it the best action moments I've seen? No, I won't lie that there is more that could have been done.-Yet, the movie accomplishes again that classic monster fight, where humanity fights this gargantuan monster and has to find the secret to beating it.-I loved the gradual approach to tackling Godzilla's wrath, the battlefields chosen, the planning, the adaptation, and again graphic work to help things come together.-Add the story investments, the stakes, and again this multiangle approach to bring everyone into the fray was stellar and it accomplished an action scene I was more invested in than many modern action movies.The Cinematography: -By far, the movie has the presentation to help add all that extra flair to the movie, helping it stand alone from what the American cinema does.-The filters on the camera alone just add so much, one part old time feel to the decade, but yet still has that sheen to keep the realism high.-Under strong direction, the crew uses great editing to help add great texture, emotion, with sad shadows of darkness during the heavier moments, and that gorgeous blue yellow and golden light during the moments of revering.-And then to pick a bunch of unique angles to give you the full effect of the chaotic moments. You'll get epic destruction from various points of views, wide shots of Godzilla seeming to choose his next target, and fast paced movement that keeps you more engaged than the static images do.-It all matches together in this artistic twist to the rather unartistic movie, and perhaps makes this movie stand out more than anything from most of the other predecessors.DISLIKES:Subtitles: -More a warning than a dislike, if you don't want to read your movie, then learn Japanese or avoid the film.-Those who don't want to keep up with faster reading, or might fall asleep, are going to struggle a bit with this movie, and you might find the acting a tad diluted because of it.More Time With Characters: -So many promising characters and only so much time to get them, Godzilla Minus One accomplishes much, but just doesn't use all the characters to the same light.-Several secondary characters that have promise and use are sort of dropped and forgotten, only randomly appearing at random times.-These side stories and character arcs hold so much potential, and then again hastily get wrapped up, and are the weaker aspects of the story.-And when it comes to one member of the family, I can't say that it was the best use, or need of a little kid compared to what they were trying to accomplish with her.-A shame given the potential, but it's bearable given the characters we do get are done so well.More Action: -No surprise here, the movie needed to hike the action up a tad more and give me one sequence or more to the final sequence to show that desperate fight.-More coordination with the military? Or maybe more time with the characters we are knowing to face the rampage could have gone a bit farther for me.-I wanted to have that epic build up and some failure, and really push it so the characters might not make it, which the final battle is building to it, but there is just more that could have been done for me.-Perhaps even having Godzilla's intelligence show a bit more like they were doing could have been added as well, to really give that intense war chess I like in movies.-Though fortunately, we still have more time and involvement with Godzilla than we did for a lot of the first movie.The VERDICT:Godzilla Minus One proves you can blend artistic style and popular movies together and freshen things up. The presentation is solid, great camera work being the lead to pull this movie together and accomplish much in this new start. Solid sound editing and great visual effects only further take this monster movie to larger heights, and brought the attitude that they needed. The Japanese cast brings a top notch performance, helping liven up fantastic dialogue and make this story feel deeper and more personable than others, putting the American stories to shame. And to bring all this together with just good character development and meshing action and story between human and beast... well it really impressed me more than I thought it would. Sure the pacing is a bit off at times, some characters get the shaft and there is more that can be done, but Minus One is a solid entry int eh Godzilla empire that I look forward to watching it again or seeing if it takes off. Most of those wanting monster mashing and monster vs. Monster, need to wait for the next entry in that universe, but for those wanting a good Jaws like movie, catch this one in theater for the best experience in my opinion.My Scores are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0."

Themes of forgiveness, survivors' guilt, PTSD, family and learning that life is a gift are all touched on here. The story of Shikishima and Noriko is full of heart, and you genuinely care about the family unit they form, which ultimately guts your heart when the King of the Monsters arrives. I teared up more than once. Godzilla is a true villain here. He's a devastating force that's here to claim Japan as his own and this film shows his power like never before. Every foot fall is felt, his tail swipe crushes buildings, his atomic breath levels everything in its path. I've never been more terrified of Godzilla than I was here. The soundtrack by Naoki Sato is perfect and the use of the Ifukube theme was amazing. The special effects are great, and the cinematography is glorious. If you've ever been a Godzilla fan or are curious why people like these movies, watch this film!!! This is a perfect example of what a Godzilla film should be!!! 10/10."

As long as the arrogance of Man exists, Godzilla will survive...\" - David Kalat, author, \"A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series\"\"Godzilla Minus One\" is living proof that in the words of one viewer over on YouTube, you can re-tell the exact same story a dozen different ways and you can still produce an excellent end-product. Japan saw fit to reboot its long-running \"Godzilla\" series with \"Shin Gojira\" back in 2016, and has re-booted the franchise, yet again, with \"Godzilla Minus One,\" which was released in Japanese theaters on November 3rd, 2023, to mark the 69th anniversary of the film that started it all, Ishiro Honda's grim black & white \"Gojira\" (1954); \"Godzilla Minus One\" saw an American theatrical release today on December 1st, 2023, making it the first Japanese-produced \"Godzilla\" film to be released theatrically in the United States since \"Shin Gojira,\" which itself was the first Japanese-produced \"Godzilla\" film to be released domestically since \"Godzilla 2000\" (1999) (which as a tearful aside, was the last film I ever saw at the Cineplex Odeon at my local shopping mall before it closed down later that summer in 2000).As most readers here know, I am a life-long Godzilla fan; \"Gojira\" is my all-time favorite giant monster movie (and 1989's \"Godzilla vs. Biollante\" is my favorite giant monster \"versus\" movie and is a unique gem amongst giant monster movies and \"Godzilla\" movies, more specifically - I love it). When I had first heard that Toho was planning on releasing yet another kaiju-eiga (\"Japanese monster movie\") featuring the mighty \"King of the Monsters,\" I began to get really excited. (It's really hard for me to get excited about most new movies these days for a litany of reasons. More on this in a bit.) Of course, Toho was keen to keep the very specific details of the movie under wraps, which only made the anticipation greater. (I had experienced that same sensation of immense excitement when \"Shin Gojira\" received a one-week distribution stateside back in 2016, and I had to drive all the way to Washington, D. C., from my home in Northern Virginia, which is where the nearest theater playing the film was located.)As written and directed by visual effects specialist Takashi Yamazaki, \"Godzilla Minus One\" takes a huge creative leap with firmly established Godzilla lore by going back to the beginning. Well, not just going back to the beginning, but going back even FURTHER than when things first began with \"Gojira\" in 1954. Yamazaki's film opens during the closing days of World War II in Japan, and ends two years later in 1947 - seven years before Honda's original. We all know the story of how a fictional dinosaur species called a \"Godzillasaurus,\" which was living on a deserted island in the South Pacific Ocean after the Second World War, was then exposed to radioactive fallout from American nuclear weapons testing in the region, and how it later mutated into a gargantuan, seemingly indestructible fire-breathing beast that later attacked Japan - Gojira (\"Godzilla,\" in English).But right there, by setting \"Godzilla Minus One\" immediately after Japan's defeat in World War II and having Godzilla appear much sooner than he did in Ishiro Honda's original, Yamazaki's film stands apart from \"Gojira\" and it gives Yamazaki some new creative and dramatic territory to explore - in this case, how Japan, already at its lowest point after having surrendered to the Allies following the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945, must now contend with another looming disaster of unprecedented scale: an attack by a gigantic, radioactive, fire-breathing monster (or daikaiju, \"giant strange beast\").The story here focuses on Imperial Japanese Navy kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who in the final days of WWII in 1945, lands on Odo Island after feigning that his plane is experiencing technical issues. He meets with the lead mechanic there, Sokaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), and during the night their camp is attacked by a giant dinosaur that comes ashore from the ocean and slaughters everyone except Shikishima and Tachibana, who comes to blame Shikishima for his hesitation at a critical moment which resulted in the deaths of all their comrades.Later that year after Japan's surrender, Shikishima, wracked with survivor's guilt, returns to Tokyo, which has been ravaged by Allied fire-bombing raids - raids that claimed the lives of both his parents. (As an aside, these scenes of a devastated post-war Tokyo have to be a visual reference to the eye-witness accounts given by Ishiro Honda himself after he'd been discharged from service overseas in the Imperial Japanese Army, and then toured Hiroshima on his way home following the city's atomic bombing, and he later used these experiences to form his vision of the character of Godzilla. And as a matter of fact, Yamazaki, as a visual effects artist, has a nice taste for shocking and unsettling imagery - the first sighting of the un-mutated Godzillasaurus, the actual first appearance of Godzilla at sea or the so-called \"black rain\" following the giant monster's later rampage on Tokyo, are some prime examples - which makes his film one of the more visually interesting \"Godzilla\" features ever produced.) While salvaging what little he has left, he meets Noriko (Minami Hamabe), another war orphan who carries in her tow, an infant girl named Akiko (Sae Nagatani), whose mother perished in the fire-bombing raids and had charged Noriko with the child's care. He allows the two of them to move in with him and a loose family of sorts is born.Pretty soon, however, Japan, which is only in the early stages of reconstruction (just at it was in \"Gojira\"), is threatened by the terror of Godzilla, who rises from the Pacific Ocean to unleash his wrath on a country that has already suffered heavy devastation brought on by nuclear bombers, and must now face a threat that could destroy the country completely. Since Japan cannot rely on its military (the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces were disbanded in 1945 following the surrender, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces - JSDF - weren't founded until July of 1954) or the United States (Japan would not begin to enter into a series of mutual security and cooperation legislative agreements with the U. S., and thus become our closest Asian ally, until the early 1950s) for aid - due to rising tensions with the Soviet Union - it is up to Shikishima and a few other dedicated private citizens to defeat Godzilla and protect what little country of theirs that is left to protect.\"Godzilla Minus One\" is a thrilling cinematic event the likes of which I have not experienced since, well, \"Shin Gojira.\" I should now state here that I rarely go to the movies anymore, as there just isn't much out there these days that truly interests me. Since superhero movies no longer carry the geeky thrill that they once did for this viewer, I found \"Godzilla Minus One\" to be a much-welcomed shot in the arm, and something very, very different from much of what I've seen lately. That it was a subtitled foreign-language feature that had received a wide distribution stateside (\"Godzilla 2000\" had a wide theatrical release back in 2000, while, as stated earlier, \"Shin Gojira\" only had a one-week engagement back in 2016), \"Godzilla Minus One\" lives up to its high expectations and by going in a different direction from the anti-bureaucratic satire of \"Shin Gojira\" and by extension the dark apocalyptic tone of \"Gojira,\" this makes it stand out from much of the fare that I've seen in recent years, and even other \"Godzilla\" films.What also makes \"Godzilla Minus One\" stand out is that it's a feature that is not steeped in nostalgia or purposeful throwbacks to the \"Godzilla\" films of yesteryear (most domestic so-called \"legacy\" features love doing that for eagle-eyed, dog-eared fans of the originals to compensate for a lack of originality). Yes, \"Godzilla Minus One\" does include some obligatory references to films past, including some familiar musical themes by the late Akira Ifukube, who also created Godzilla's signature roar in the original 1954 \"Gojira\" and who remained Japan's most esteemed composer until his death in 2006. But this film is not about an avid fan-boy geeking out and showing off his hero-worship of the material. No, \"Godzilla Minus One\" is simply a tale of a country trying to pick itself up again following the end of a devastating conflict - a conflict that nearly destroyed the nation - and having to face a force of nature more dangerous and destructive than any war. That is perhaps where Takashi Yamazaki succeeds the most, and his film is also not steeped in the usual anti-American resentment and finger-pointing and anti-nuclear allegory, and - and! - the assertive pro-Japanese nationalist sentiment of most recent \"Godzilla\" movies (a more recent phenomenon that has been pervasive in many \"Godzilla\" features since the early 1990s, after Japan had fully rebuilt its economy and was looking to re-assert itself on the global market).\"Godzilla Minus One\" is a \"Godzilla\" film that was well worth the seven-year wait.\"Godzilla Minus One\" rates a solid \"10.\"10/10."

The main cast were perfect together as a group, even the minor characters were amazing. The music, Oh My God the Music was conducted to fit every scene it was in and the OG theme was incredible to hear in a Dolby theater for the first time. Akira Ifukube would be proud, May he Rest In Peace. Lastly it was very educating in a way to see what Japan was like immediately after the War following the Atomic Bombs. The hardships they went through just to rebuild was very emotional to watch, but the way they climbed out of that pit of hopelessness would inspire any viewer to the franchise both Long Time along with Newer FansNow to the matter at Hand, the Star Himself, GODZILLA.The King of the Monsters is more terrifying in this movie than any other in the 69 year history of the Longest running franchise in the World! Every time he appears on screen he strikes fear into your very soul and leaves you in Awe at the same time. His destruction was unrelenting, the action out of this world, his Power Godly, his portrayal Very Real. At times you almost feel sorry for him because what's happened to him wasn't his fault. I haven't seen a monster movie this well done since Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) and Cloverfield (2008).My solid review of this movie is a 10/10, and I recommend save notifications of any kind for when this movie hits the Home Media market because I sure will.Honestly I don't think I've ever watched a movie this perfect beforeLast note, The Whole Theater shook everytime Godzilla took a Step and my very bones were vibrating from his Roar #godzilla #godzilla1954 #godzillaminusone #monster #japan."

It's no doubt thanks to all new creators' mindset to try to outperform the previous works, based on and standing at the established brand \"Godzilla\". All the successors can benchmark the prior ones and analyze their successful points and failures. Yamazaki learned a lot from Anno's work and made some improvements and corrections particularly on the point that it couldn't catch on overseas. One of them is the music. He succeeded in taking on Naoki Sato, who is the graduate of Tokyo university of the arts, paying respect to the alumni and predecessor Ifukube and understanding his music deeply. In this film, vision and music are fantastically synchronized. And of course, the main character is Godzilla, but Yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object. Therefore, we can empathize fully with characters competing with Godzilla. Yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence, and is expected to deliver another sequel of Godzilla film, in which we can see a \"real\" duel with monsters like Ghidra or Mothra."

Although some military men assist them, the Japanese realize that their government won't save them. Scientists and former military men come together, borrow some military equipment form a plan to defeat Godzilla.It is also a story about cowardice, the crippling shame that comes with it, and how cowardice can actually buy time for one to build one's courage.

This film not only is a good movie BUT is also one the best \"monster\" movies I've seen. It's a return to form for the franchise with surprisingly great results.

(Source: IMDb)When was the last time that we witnessed a 'monster film' that didn't have a cheap script with a target of just making lots of money?Minus one proves that it's not entirely a film about a monster, rather it's a film about humanity, Inner self, grief, and family. The film was able to create a story about Godzilla but from a different perspective by combining both drama and action together. Brining a character that struggles with himself, his past, his grief, and his PTSD. As well as adding side characters that will bring a more dramatic experience to his life and to audience members.Moreover, the film really surprised me by using Japan's tragedy after the WWII, and building the film's plot around it. Bringing room to some great political topics that connects and affects the film's story and events.The film unfortunately lacks during a few scenes with bad CGI that looks bad and cheap and results in an ugly still frame. Moreover, I low-key found Godzilla's look to be...childish. It doesn't seem like he is a 'monster', rather a kids action figure.Overall, an experience that must be watched on the biggest screen possible, especially that GREAT 'MONSTER FILMS' WITH A GOAL TO PLEASE THE AUDIENCE are very very RARE."

I'm Back!\" was the Independence Day movie quote I thought about during this movie and it really fit for more ways than Minus One.It would be hard to rank this amongst other Godzilla movies considering I've probably only seen one-fourth of the Thirty-Eight (38!!) films, but I can safely say this would be in the top three. Maybe top two? I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE. Possibly only the first one from 1954 could top it as it was original, deep and far ahead of its time.Weird...there's this recent trend of making Reboot/Remake/Sequel/Prequels of classics - all rolled into one. Only some kinda work. This MORE than works. Its setting was perfect and I truly can't believe this never occurred to them before. This was kinda like the Rogue (Minus) One of Godzilla flicks.Immediately at the end of WWII and through the recovery process, Japan is hit once again, but this time by a VICIOUS, ANGRY God...zilla. They hadn't even begun to put the pieces of their lives back together and the big guy isn't going to let them off the hook for WWII. In fact, you actually feel very sorry for our old enemy (at the time) because of the giant green's wrath halting their healing.But, that's just the Godzilla portion of the movie. The REAL plot has incredible heart. I even teared up several times.The real story is of a \"coward\" who dodged Kamikazeing himself at the end of WWII and the repercussions of that. While he's trying to heal/cope, in comes both the title character and a new family to help care for. You follow him, his new friends and partner of sorts with a baby girl while he's dealing with both PTSD and the big baddie who's really into destruction.I know a ton of Godzilla/Kaiju films focus on the humans more than the monsters for various reasons: cheaper to shoot humans than large battles/annihilation scenes, probably can only show a giant monster stomping around for so long and we're supposed to root for the central characters, for examples. But, of ALL the Godzilla movies, including the Monsterverse (2014's Godzilla, 2019's Godzilla: King of the Monsters and 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong) that I really love a lot, not a single Godzilla movie made me care this much about the characters. I really felt something for the main characters A TON.Overall, I really loved the settings, cinematography, CGI, ALL of the characters here, the depth and scope of the stakes at hand, the POV of the Japanese after WWII and what their country did to their own citizens and how they improved the Godzilla look. He looked FANTASTIC. Plus, the new way they handled his atomic breath...absolutely amazing.I cannot recommend this movie enough. I truly hope this opens the door to much more mature, thought-out and well-made Godzilla films made by all-around great talents.***Final Thoughts: While it wasn't the very last one, I'm SUPER GLAD this was 1000x better than the last Japanese-made Godzilla film I saw: 2016's Shin Godzilla. I took a chance with Minus One after being INCREDIBLY let down by Shin Godzilla. That was a two-hour movie where Godzilla clocked in for about 5-minutes of screentime MOST of which was him evolving from a Laugh-Out-Loud, bugged-eyed CGI-abomination. The rest of the movie were board members in a boring room trying to decide what to do about the creature. Minus One was the POLAR opposite of Shin, thank God...zilla."

                    "content": "Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."

                    "content": "\"She's like nothing you've ever seen\"The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but \"visually striking\" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"

An absolutely brilliant performance, especially by Emma Stone (I'm quite sure she will win an Oscar for this!), a fantastic set and costume design, I'm not even getting started on storytelling, cinematography and editing...

She develop conscience and slowly carved herself into womanhood with some few man getting on her way.The First two thirds of the film works really well.Emma, Rufallo, Ramy Youssef were marvelous in their respective role.You could feel that Yorgos really camped it up and could see how he was enjoying the material. The visual game too in these portion is through the roof. All the jokes were hitting well. AND while do feel weird thinking that this is a baby trying to heck out of her loins, the most important thing about this is that there is a constant growth in Stone's character. She develops a childlike confidence in her ideas AND develop empathy. AND even gives some pointed observation of the questionable people around him.But something went south after the Paris scene.Everything that it is heading towards suddenly felt very empty.I just do not know if Emma's character is representing everything at all. Suddenly, all her growth just felt surface level. She wants everything and just gets everything. It became that 'Genius' plot AND it seems to lose track of what she really represent. It just became pure fantasia without any kind or semblance of a stakes. She just wants, and she gets. That really bothered me, since then film is positioned that she killed herself because she feels stifled by the her husband and his controlling ways.Its a liberation alright BUT it does not know what is she being liberated from. She just is free BUT with everything free to begin with.Overall, a great setup that fails to stick its landing. Overhyped."

Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."

                    "content": "\"I must go punch that baby.\"The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very \"risky\" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, \"Never go full stupid\", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, \"Alright, I get it.\"Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good? This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful, dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls in the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect.

We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time, like other human beings for instance. More trivial human \"experiences\" like Emma Stone discovering what \"eating\" is like are quite amusing to watch as well.

                    "content": "While he is unmistakably a unique voice in cinema, I'm not as big of a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos as many critics and cinephiles tend to be. I sometimes feel that his films focus more on attempting to provoke and shock the viewer rather than, and at the expense of, putting compelling storytelling first. While his quirky and risqué new film \"Poor Things\" doesn't completely overcome that concern, it is a step in the right direction from a storytelling perspective. An occasionally rudderless plot and some not very well developed supporting characters prevents it from being a home run, but it's still a solid film that should please independent film lovers who know what they're getting themselves into.The film centers on Bella Baxter, a woman who is brought back to life with the brain of her baby by Goodwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe, who Bella refers to as \"God.\") The movie primarily centers around Bella's development and autonomy as she begins to understand the world around her, including her relationships with two very different men and her gradual questioning of her purpose and desire for liberation within the confines of a patriarchal society, particularly as it relates to sex. Despite some darker undertones, this premise has plenty of fodder for humor, which Lanthimos delivers. There is deadpan and screwball-style humor in various places throughout the film that feels clever and incisive, although some jokes feel a bit too forced or repetitive. The jokes and writing are complemented by the performances, which are generally very good but not always optimally effective in displaying a strong range. Emma Stone is great, however, as Bella. The supporting cast is generally good, including Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe and Ramy Youssef, although I would not necessarily say any of them uniquely stand out. What does stand out within the confines of the narrative, however, is the film's stunning production design of fantastical Victorian Europe, which is stunning to look at and combines a variety of unique aesthetic choices and color palettes to great success. The film probably didn't need to be nearly two and a half hours long, and some scenes feel a bit dragged out or lacking in purpose, yet the outrageous and blackly comic tone accentuated by the bold stylistic choices on display here make the film a worthwhile viewing experience. Recommended to those okay with graphic sexual material. 7/10."

So if somehow somebody of the organizers of the festival see this, I'm so grateful, it was a special night and even the idiots in the public couldn't ruin it for me. That's what we should see in Bulgarian cinemas. Anyway, now to the point.One is certain, this is a movie that is not just one of the hottest and most successful films of the year, but a movie that instantly becomes part of cinematic history. It's so beautiful and accurate in capturing a person's development and clashing with the world. I won't be able to describe the professional means used to accomplish the whole experience, but ones you see it, it's impossible not to feel it. At the same time, the movie is definitely not pretentious in any way, regardless of the depths of the philosophical problems that it covers - live, death, faith, God, poverty, social classes, inequality of sexes, trauma, love and etc. It is so normal in its own abnormality which for me is making it so special and close to my heart. And, of course, the humor. Don't know if there is such a thing as your type of humor, but if it exists, this definitely is mine. And everything is brought to life(literally in this case) by these talented, talented people - the actors.I'm sure this type of movie will bring broad audience among which way more eloquent and experienced people than me who will have something more appropriate to say about the movie(not to mention the critics reviews that are already available), but I believe that shouldn't stop me from trying to express what something so special made me feel and think about.

He's definitely a \"twisted mind,\" overindulging in the fisheye effect, but that doesn't detract from the film's brilliance.In short, Willem Dafoe is someone like Dr. Frankenstein, who even physically resembles the doctor's creation from the classic films. Here, he has created... Emma Stone - a beautiful woman with a baby's brain transplanted into her, and she's just starting to explore the world. The first part is quite dark, black and white, repellent, often resorting to the mentioned fisheye. Everything changes when the heroine awakens her sexual sensuality and begins to experience reality through it. Suddenly, the film becomes richly colorful and even funny. Throughout, it maintains its intelligent humor, shining in every scene, with the main focus being the questioning the postulates of the world surrounding the characters (something like the end of the 19th or early 20th century, but with many elements of steampunk) through the unburdened consciousness of a child in a woman's body.I generally have reservations about Lanthimos's aesthetics, often crossing certain boundaries. And it's present here, but in moderate doses, mainly in the beginning. But the fact that I was charmed by the film despite my reservations should speak even more. I believe it should win not only the Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival but also any Golden Globes, Oscars, or whatever else is up to be grabbed this season. And Emma Stone, too.

Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo are definitely at their best here. Willem Defoe's performance is wonderful as well. You could feel through the screen that the cast had so much fun making this film.That said... the story, the dialogue, the point? If there was one? All fell flat for me. It felt like weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Firstly, let's really think about the story for a moment. A mad scientist finds a pregnant woman teetering in the space between life and death, and brings her back to consciousness by putting her unborn baby's brain in her skull. In the beginning of the film, Bella is like a toddler. Breaking things, throwing tantrums, walking funny. Then one day out of nowhere she starts playing with herself and becomes sex-obsessed. This is... questionable. Concerning. Was weird to watch as a pregnant woman myself. Okay, I thought, just an awkward part of our protagonist's development. NOPE! The rest of the film is centered around her sexual escapades. First playing with herself, then using an apple for her sexual pleasure, then asking her fiancé to \"do\" her, then running off with a colleague of her father's because he gropes her w/o consent and she likes it, then becoming a prostitute to make money in Paris. The sex scenes in the film are frequent, raw, graphic, and really hard to watch. (keep in mind that she's supposed to have the mind of a child!)About halfway through Bella Baxter's time in Paris, my husband and I were considering walking out. And we're not prude or anything- we saw Saltburn a few weeks ago and thought it was so fun. We walked out of Poor Things, looked at each other, and rolled our eyes. I was left feeling like a lot of Bella's potential was left unexplored, like her desire to learn, become a surgeon, understand what lead to her suicide, etc. All of those things were an afterthought compared to her interest in what she calls \"furious jumping\".Three stars for the visuals and the acting. As for the whole package? Disappointing and vastly overrated."

It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of \"Barbie\" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"

Movie goers tend to either love his films like THE FAVOURITE (2018), THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017), THE LOBSTER (2015), and DOGTOOTH (2009) or walk away baffled that any decent human being could enjoy such dark works of strangeness and oddity. Despite this, two of his films have received Oscar nominations, and this latest may be both his most accessible and most outrageous project yet. It's also a rare outing where Lanthimos left the writing to others. His co-writer on THE FAVOURITE, Tony McNamara (\"The Great\") has adapted the screenplay from the 1992 novel by renowned Scottish writer Alasdair Gray, whose tome was influenced by Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\".Oscar winner Emma Stone delivers a truly remarkable (and physically demanding) performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet Bella, she has the mind and coordination of a toddler in an adult woman's body ... the product of Dr. Godwin Baxter (you can call me God), played by Willem Dafoe. God is a surgeon-slash-mad scientist, his own scarred body the result of experiments conducted by his father. God is both doctor and monster. Although various animal blends (ducks, chickens, dogs, etc) roam the premises, it is Bella who is clearly God's most treasured production. Her reanimation process and backstory are spelled out in the movie.Bella develops daily, and when Godwin's lawyer, Duncan Wedderbum (Mark Ruffalo) shows up to take care of some business, he is intrigued by Bella and offers to take her on an adventure ... one that ultimately spans Lisbon to Paris, and a luxury cruise ship to a brothel. Duncan and Bella engage in \"furious jumping\" (her phrase for sex) and soon her libido is quite advanced, and her river of independence flows freely, turning Duncan into a whiny buffoon. This story, Bella's story, is really about a woman finding her own way in a world where men try to control/manager her. It's fascinating to see her hyper curiosity about the world and her surroundings. On top of that, Bella is often quite direct and unfiltered in her statements.The humor here is frequent and unconventional as evidenced by Bella being described as \"a beautiful retard\", and the stream of deadpan one-liners. Still, the message comes across loudly and clearly as we marvel at Bella and Emma Stone's performance. I hesitate to use the word fearless (unless it's Tom Cruise) since it's just acting, but the word applies to Ms. Stone here. Supporting work comes from Christopher Abbott, Margaret Qualley, Ramy Yussef, Jarrod Carmichael, Hannah Schygulla, and Kathryn Hunter, while Mark Ruffalo revels in flashing his comedic chops.Cinematographer Robbie Ryan interjects black and white for effect and makes good use of the fish-eye lens. Production Designers James Price and Shona Heath get creative with set pieces, especially the cruise ship and brothel, and Costume Designer Holly Waddington nearly steals the spotlight with Bella's outfits, which are always a bit exaggerated. The music adds a specific element and works quite well, and there is a truly awesome dance scene. Yorgos Lanthimos again earns the title Master of Strangeness with this outlandish film with bits from Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Young Frankenstein (a common thread). The film is somehow both extremely funny and severely disturbing, and is an example of good people trying to come to grips with the realization that people often do bad things. My only complaint is the film features what are possibly the worst closing credits ever.Opening in theaters on December 8, 2023."

Set in a finely crafted landscape and time, it subtly deconstructs the 'polite society' through adventures, experiments, and embodied exploration in societal slices, making it a feminist cult film. It's one of the best movies I've seen recently.Many people might compare it to 'Barbie', which, beneath its commercial veneer, offers shallow, didactic content and a direct satire of the present. However, 'Poor Things' delves deeper into dark fantasy and absurdity. In the end, it doesn't dissect and reconstruct patriarchy and privileged society, representing a return to reality in another sense.The movie also reminded me of 'Killers of the Flower Moon' and 'Babylon.' The former because I rewatched it yesterday and I, despite noticing more details from Scorsese's masterpiece, still maintain my initial view that it overly stereotypes women from a 'straight white male perspective,' fitting too realistically into the era. 'Poor Things,' however, perfectly balances this offset from 'Killers.' As for 'Babylon,' which I watched at the end of last year in the similar time, it's filled with bizarre physical and visual spectacles, but compared to 'Poor Things,' it's too full, too noisy, and tries too hard."

The strong cast also contributes to a more descriptive portrayal of the types of people who can appear in your life's journey. The dramatic experience can captivate you from start to finish.After the movie ends, you'll find yourself pondering how the story would have unfolded if the characters' appearances were in a different order. Nevertheless, the movie may seem a bit strange in the first half-hour as you try to explore what it's all about. The beginning of this film appears somewhat similar to \"Flowers for Algernon,\" albeit in a more vulgar way, but it still evokes strong similarities.I also admired Emma Stone's costumes. The humor in the movie is quite debatable; there are genuinely funny jokes and moments, but if you delve deeper, it can take on a darker tone. Nonetheless, it's very enjoyable, and you might find it satisfying.In conclusion, for my very first review, I can confidently say that it's truly worth seeing. It will provoke a range of controversial thoughts and feelings due to its polarizing scenes. I rated it a 9 only because I'm not a big fan of explicit scenes on the big screen, and you should also be prepared for a significant number of erotic moments in the film."

Director Yorgos Lanthimos, known for his bizarre and unsettling films like The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, delivers another distinctive and thought-provoking work.Emma Stone shines as Bella Baxter, portraying her transformation from a naive child to a defiant woman with captivating charm and depth. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Mark Ruffalo delivering a memorable performance as the eccentric scientist and Olivia Colman adding her usual comedic flair.The film's visuals are captivating, featuring meticulously crafted sets and costumes that evoke the Victorian era with a touch of the surreal. The use of color, lighting, and cinematography is masterful, creating a visually stunning and immersive world for the characters to inhabit.Lanthimos' signature dark humor is present throughout the film, often used to satirize societal norms and challenge traditional gender roles. While some may find the humor unsettling or uncomfortable, it effectively complements the film's themes and adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.The film's central themes of identity, societal expectations, and female empowerment are explored through Bella's journey of self-discovery. As she encounters prejudice and discrimination, she learns to challenge the status quo and forge her own path. While the message may be delivered with a heavy dose of Lanthimos' signature absurdity, it resonates deeply and leaves a lasting impression.However, the film is not without its flaws. The narrative can feel uneven at times, with some scenes dragging on and others feeling rushed. Additionally, the film's ending may leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied or confused.Overall, Poor Things is a compelling and challenging film that pushes the boundaries of traditional filmmaking. It is not a film for everyone, as its dark humor and bizarre elements may be off-putting to some viewers. However, for those who appreciate Lanthimos' unique style and are willing to engage with its complex themes, Poor Things is a rewarding experience offering a stimulating and unforgettable cinematic journey."

But the way that result comes about here represents a truly inspired fusion of genres, including comedy, romance, social commentary and sci-fi, making for one of the most inventive, unusual and hilarious releases of recent years. This offbeat feminist fable tells the story of how a pregnant, young, anonymous suicide victim (Emma Stone) is reanimated with the aid of a brain transplant from her unborn fetus, an achievement accomplished by a colorful, controversial but well-meaning surgeon/scientist a la Dr. Frankenstein (Willem Dafoe). He nurtures his subject back to life, health and sentience, a sometimes-challenging process that finally surfaces when she discovers sexuality, the trigger for exploring a new, independent life for herself, both physically and emotionally. Through a series of adventures over the course of a trip through Europe with a free-wheeling, lusty but lecherous, self-serving lawyer (Mark Ruffalo), she finds herself as a self-actualized woman in an age where that's more of a rarity than a standard, particularly in a world where men treat women more like property than people. While the film's pacing could use some shoring up in the middle, this offering nevertheless entertains with uproarious laughs throughout, even when the narrative turns more thoughtful and substantive. The superb performances by Stone, Dafoe and Ruffalo are top shelf, contributing to the picture's whopping 13 Critics Choice Award and 7 Golden Globe Award nominations. The film is also visually stunning in its cinematography and editing, as well as in its spectacular and whimsical production design, filled with images reminiscent of the movies of Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam while sustaining a look all its own. Admittedly, this release features a good deal of explicit sexuality, both visually and in the dialogue, so sensitive viewers should take note. However, as one of the most anticipated pictures of this year's awards season, \"Poor Things\" never disappoints, serving up a solid offering that consistently tickles the funny bone while giving audiences much to think about - and there's nothing poor in any of that."

You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and \"The Holdovers\" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.\"The Holdovers\" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and \"The Holdovers\" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is \"The Holdovers.\" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."

It follows the experiences of the \"holdovers,\" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).\"The Holdovers\" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. \"The Holdovers\" is a great Christmas movie."

Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is \"Discomfort and Joy\", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. \"Entre nous\" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."

It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way \"Harold and Maude\" was.

He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, \"I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.\"Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.\"Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer....\" Paul Hunham."

Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the \"I like this\" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a \"field trip\" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into \"oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great\" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was \"whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?\" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."

Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"

Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 \"holdovers\", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (\"Sideways\", \"The Descendants\"). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.\"The Holdovers\" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."

While an American director, his films (usually) stayed away from the typical American predictable, simplistic, good guy/ bad guy stereotypes and easy solutions.The Holdovers has an interesting premise and interesting main characters: a nerdy history teacher, a troubled student and a sad cook. The depiction of high cost private boarding schools is pretty realistic and the characters are well contoured. There are some clever dialogues and some intelligently constructed scenes. The plot keeps one engaged from one end to another of the film.Having said that, one leaves the cinema with the nagging feeling that this was not quite what one expects from Mr. Payne. In my opinion, he \"sold out\" to mainstream American cinema. The bad guys are really bad; the good guys, well, God bless them. There are some \"deus ex machina\" solutions (a helicopter landing on campus - really?) and the eventual explanations for everything going on was quite contrived and simplistic, in the good ol' Hollywood tradition.A good film for a Netflix evening - definitely.Something Mr. Payne can put on his resume along \"Sideways\" and \"About Smith\" - not so much.PS: The film is rated R. Why? Because there are a few swear words and some people smoking and drinking?"

That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as \"Sideways,\" \"The Descendants,\" and \"Nebraska,\" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So \"The Holdovers\" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."

They broke the entire concept of the movie. The entire premise is that they are stuck in the school together, to the point where when the helicopter takes off, you feel a sense of dread that they're now alone, trapped together and must make due, must find grace in the discomfort, learn all those lessons. This is a great premise for a film and it must work in that premise. SUDDENLY, they're going out to bars, to parties, to the city, to insane asylums, to bowling alleys. This is is a problem so fundamentally wrong with the movie it sinks the entire thing in my view. To start with, it's lazy, but artistically, it's cowardly. The helicopter taking off now means nothing because they hit the road regardless. Imagine in The Breakfast Club they escape the school and go on a road trip with ten different stops. It's no longer The Breakfast Club then, it becomes Ferris Bueller's Day Off; as in here, in the Holdover, there is no Holdover to speak of. They aren't trapped in the school, they just go wherever they fancy, with this gigantic god-eye copout of 'well we have a field trip fund so let's throw the screenplay out the window'. Bait and switching the premise is one of my great pet peeves in films, and it's a shame because they set out to make a great film but Payne couldn't help it, he is unable to break out this mold of making road-trip films, and there I was refreshed going in that he was trying something new."

That said, the story and the plot is simplicity itself, and not all that remarkable or new--it's in the execution that the whole crew hits it out of the park. Now as if my own voice as an academic isn't pretentious enough, here's channeling the POV of a stuck-up film critic from my next life:Been a fan of Payne from the beginning--I remember driving all the way to Omaha Nebraska in the middle of one of those thick midwestern fogs to catch ABOUT SCHMIDT in the theatre--so I was favorably predisposed towards the movie, not to mention towards Paul Giamatti as well after seeing him in SIDEWAYS. But the story and the movie still had to earn my trust--which it did by the time the young lead, Dominic Sessa, appeared in his initial scenes. Giamatti was funny as the teacher (some would call him cranky but I would only call him real, having taught for more than twenty years myself)--but Dominic really sold the character of Angus because watching him I was reminded of my nephew a lot who also happens to be in high school right now.Again, the plot is simplicity itself: Dominic who plays high school student Angus ends up staying over on campus between terms because his mom and stepfather switch plans at the last minute, opting to go on their honeymoon instead of staying home for the holidays. To watch over Angus two adults stay over at school too--the aforementioned teacher Paul (essayed by Giamatti) and the cook (played by Da' Vine Joy Randolph of MURDERS IN THE BUILDING fame). The latter, a single mother, also just lost her son in Vietnam. With these three main characters in the mix--admittedly very different from each other--the movie's magic is about how the drama and even comedy develops organically as a result. The fineness of execution I mentioned earlier is key here--everything works so well for us precisely because very little is overblown.Must mention that I was slightly disappointed to learn this was shot digitally with film grain added later--but I understand the choice better now after hearing the DP discuss the matter in a Cinematography podcast, where he explained how they experimented with shooting on film at first, but then realized that they would have to alter things in post-production anyway given the \"70s film look\" they were going for."

It may be an elaborate trap.This complex, beautiful, deeply imaginative, and many-layered film continues Miyazaki's amazing and awe-inspiring legacy. He is one of my favorite directors. In nature, wisdom about living, magic, charismatic guides (female as well as male), folklore, cute puffball critters, war/chaos, wackiness including flesh-eating parakeets, portals to other worlds, loss, and love, Miyazaki continues to run with favorite and endearing themes. The film is full of insight into what it means to be human. I was so happy to be part of the first audience to see the film outside of Japan.There is depth in the story, characters, music, voices (much better in Japanese), and especially the artwork. I'm mesmerized just by the drawings and movement of the clouds. Oh and there are fantastic and intricately drawn ocean waves, moonlight reflected on water, vivid colors, resplendent contrasts of light and dark, elaborate tree branches, night skies with resplendent stars and meteors, grasses realistically swaying in the wind, alluring shadows, and so much more.

This is all right, because Hayao Miyazaki has come out of retirement again to offer us a parable about how you can have a family, if you're willing to be accepting. Once again, it's filled with giant, evil parakeets, toy balloon animals that float to the moon, and a sense that there are rules in operation here, even if you don't understand them.

It was announced almost as a surprise with the words \"Hayao Miyazaki's last movie\". With this amount of hype, including the amazing reviews it's got from critics, my hype was built up to the max. The end result? Not what I expected, and that's ok!Let's get to the positives, the animation is STUNNING. The way Hayao Miyazaki manages to build these worlds and characters is just an amazing feat, they all come alive with the colours and the movement. Another positive is the tone of the movie, I really hate Disney for trying to market this as a kid's movie, when it's not. It's got some unnerving and scary moments and themes that are not suited for kids, which is good. Hayao Miyazaki is at his best when he manages to blend the adult with the fantastical.The actors are always amazing, I saw the Japanese dub so I don't know how the western VAs are doing but wow; they all do a fantastic job!Now to the negatives... a huge thing about Studio Ghibli movies in general, especially the ones from Hayao Miyazaki, is that they're always by rule driven by the characters, it's their journey that's in the front. World building and narrative always takes a second place in his movies to be able to not distract from the characters journeys, big examples of this are Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle where the world building is built by very simple and effective means and rules. But here in the Boy and The Heron the world building is so convoluted and confusing it almost feels like he wanted it to take center stage in this movie and it's such a shame because it feels at like it's at odds with it's own main character who supposedly undergoes a deep deep emotional journey but it all finishes off in a very abrupt and unfitting send-off in the end which really confused me and just didn't feel like a good payoff.Also the way this movie introduces characters left and right with no rhyme or reason is super confusing. Once again, Hayao Miyazaki did this very minimally in his past movies where the characters get room to be explored and to leave an impact in the story but here once again it's at odds with its own world building- it all feels very haphazard and messy. The Heron is a fun character but I don't feel like he or Mahito do or learn anything from these adventures.Now, it may sound like I hated this movie, but I didn't. It's just that I care so much about Hayao Miyazaki movies and Studio Ghibli movies that I can't help to compare them to the movies we've seen before.

                    "content": "I've probably started a review of a Hayao Miyazaki film stating it's his final film before, but \"The Boy and the Heron\", for more reasons than one, certainly feels like the final cut. Now aged eighty-two with an ever-increasing gap between films, it would sadly appear unlikely another feature will be made. \"The Boy and the Heron\" would show that Miyazaki now also knows the gig is up, feeling like a culmination of a life's work, looking backwards rather than forwards.Mahito's (Soma Santoki) mother is killed in a Tokyo fire, and so later goes to live in the countryside with his father and stepmother (also his aunt). His father the owner of an aeronautics factory, he has a large plot to explore, finding a mysterious old building. But he also finds himself stalked by a grey heron (Masaki Suda) who appears to mean him harm.But with his stepmother Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura) going missing, he confronts the heron and the pair go looking for her, finding themselves at the mysterious building of unknown origin. This takes them into worlds within worlds, as they are helped and hindered along the way by various people and creatures.There's a lot going on here, and, it's fair to say, too much. There are some good moments, but this is a film that gets a little lost within itself as it tries to squeeze in too much into its two hours. While there are similarities in all of his films, each has its own unique charm. \"The Boy and the Heron\", however, feels more like a greatest hits parade, with many moments reminiscent of what has come before. You can probably go through the whole film and equate moments to earlier works every step of the way.Whether intentional or not, this can show both a filmmaker struggling for original ideas, but also a messy and convoluted storyline that can become difficult to follow and disengaging. Miyazaki films can almost be made by their moments for reflection, but here you barely feel able to breath as we race into another world of new characters. The result is a film that has some of the confusion and struggles of some of Ghibli's - not just Miyazaki's - lesser works, such as \"The Cat Returns\" (2002) and \"Tales from Earthsea\" (2006).A problem for Miyazaki is that you are judging his films by such high standards, in a career that has never really declined, just become sparse. This is good, but it is by no means great; probably most reminiscent of \"How's Moving Castle\" (2005) in that it tries to open too many doors. Miyazaki is at his best when he keeps things simple, but feels like he's trying to push the magic and wonder here, rather than let it out naturally.Comedy is perhaps the strength of the film, with more outright laughs than I can remember from Miyazaki before. To start, the elderly maids of the country house, while familiar in design, have the mannerisms of excited children, hungry for treats from the big city. Though Suda as the heron is the standout, starting as a squawking threat, but becoming the buddy sidekick and a constant source of humour, as one of Miyazaki's most comical characters.As ever, Joe Hisaishi delivers a memorable soundtrack, with a sparse and simple piano a reminder that Ghibli is at its best when uncomplicated. And simplicity is the word for the somewhat abrupt ending. In a film that has so much going on, the coda is almost notable in its inactivity, and feels like a fitting way to end. A career that has brought so much, should say a quick goodbye and leave us with good memories.Politic1983.home.blog."

I was highly looking forward to this movie strictly because it was the first time I got the opportunity to see a Miyazaki film on the big screen. And the English dub is studded with talent.I must say... I feel let down. I almost fell asleep halfway through, and the ending didn't make sense. There was so much happening and things weren't explained. I understand that there was probably deep symbolism attached to certain writing choices, but what's the point if the viewer has no idea what they're trying to say?There were some good scenes and some good humor, but overall I feel a little empty."

Like those films it inhibits a certain darkness and maturity at times with a war as a backdrop, that is not really aimed at children. I personally liked it and wished that more filmmakers in animation would have similar aspirations, but I guess those who do are expelled to do short movies. But back to Miyazaki's movie: it is bursting with lots of ideas, symbolism and fairy tale motifs like Snow White (with a dead mother, seven dwarfettes and a glass coffin with a sleeping beauty). At other times the character dynamics invoke Jim Henson's Labyrinth, where the protagonist has to rescue a kidnapped loved one and work with a henchman who sells him out at every opportunity until they start bonding.All the visual ideas are great but sometimes they can unnecessary bloat the picture. It is one of Miyazaki weaknesses to be over-indulgent and unfocused at times, sometimes he needs to tighten the story in certain places - especially during the last stretch it can feel exhausting. I still like the leisurely pace in the beginning and that the movie takes it's time to slowly pull us into another world/afterlife/beforelife however you want to call this place. There are beautiful visual metaphors like when the little balloon creatures fly off into the next world, one can say that those symbolize the protagonists own emotions bubbling up into the surface (this is also the first sequence where we see the main character smile and express genuine emitions) - and that he tries to repress those feelings. Especially towards his new stepmom which he tries to rescue seemingly out of pure obligation for his father. It is also no coincidence that we witness the appearance of an avatar of his real mother in that very same sequence - she tries to protect those cute balloons from hungry predators, but in the process burns most of them. The clinging to the ghost from the past is preventing a new blossoming/beginning. There simply aren't easy and clean-cut solutions, neither in nature nor our society.There are certain moments where someone can get the impression that Miyazaki is making a statement towards his own legacy and the studio he helped to build. There are themes of responsibility & duty versus family sharing a lot of similarities to his last movie 'The Wind Rises' . I appreciated the ending, without getting into any spoiler territory, a lot of people wondered or were baffled why the final scene feels sort of \"tacked on\". But when you closely observe it, it is sound with the movie's themes and illustrates rather well the important choice of our main character."

Then you will enjoy The Boy and Heron. It isn't the strongest of Hayao Miyazaki and Ghibli films but a very good addition to their filmography.The film begins with a slow pace of mostly visually defining the world, characters and their dilemmas.

I would've ranked it maybe #8 or #9 in a Miyazaki ranking after watching it the first time, but now, I think I might honestly rank it as high as #2. The only film of his I definitely like more is Princess Mononoke (that one's a classic - little can touch it).The first time, I was overwhelmed and somewhat confused, but never bored. It's so beautiful to look at that following what was going on felt secondary. The second time around, it's still beautiful, I like the music even more, and also, I have to say, seeing it for a second time with subtitles instead of the dub helped (though the English dub was of pretty good quality, it does have to be said).I looked into how people were interpreting the film following watching it for the first time, I'll admit. I wasn't clever enough to crack the subtext, but the reading that the granduncle is a stand-in for Miyazaki, and the fantastical world represents Miyazaki's work... it's so apparent now. Having that in mind just changed the entire final half-hour for me, and though part of me feels a little slow for not \"getting\" it, I also respect the film not spelling it out, but having it there clear as day once you know that's (almost certainly) the main subtextual element.But even on an emotional level, things just clicked more this time around. Understanding how certain elements of the fantasy world lined up with reality from the start made things more moving and improved the pacing; it was less like a random stream of events, which is kind of how it felt the first time around. I appreciated the protagonist's arc more, I liked the side characters more, and I think I even found more humor (as well as more sadness) in the film the second time around.The Boy and the Heron was still really good after one watch, for the visual and musical elements alone. But the second time around, it was something else. I still think the pacing is a tiny bit slow in places, but I feel that way about every Miyazaki movie. And the ending... I do wish there'd been just something else that happened in that kind of abrupt final scene. But other than those nitpicks, this is an almost-perfect animated film."

How we must have evil in order for good to exist. It all made for a wonderful metaphor I think suited for the realm of our mind like how we must look for compensation between our good and bad deeds. As usual sending a message for every one of us to decipher in our own different way.All things considered I still found this worthy of Ghibli but not at the same heights as others of their masterpieces."

So, when I say I didn't particularly like \"The Boy and the Heron\"...well, that says a lot.The story is confusing and the ending seems, well, to kind of contradictory. I'll TRY to give a brief overview. The story is set in Japan during the later portion of WWII, though the war seems to play very little part in the story. It begins with a fire in which Mahito's mother is killed. A few years pass and Mahito and his father have moved out to the country because the father's fiancee lives there...plus, it is the war and being in a city was NOT a good thing. Mahito is shocked when a heron begins talking to him...and a weird human-like face emerges from the bill. Eventually, he and the heron enter a weird parallel world caused, apparently, by a strange meteorite and his great-great uncle. What happens next is confusing, so I'll just stop here.So many confusing story elements. Why did Mahito smash a rock against his skull early in the story? Why did the great-great uncle say he wanted Mahito's help...but then Mahito wakes up in chains! And, later, the great-great uncle says how much he likes Mahito...but what about the chains? There were more strange and inexplicable occurrances.While some might say that Miyazaki had made other confusing and difficult films, if you know about Japanese folklore and religion, films like \"Spirited Away\" make MUCH more sense. But this one is just confusing...and probably will be to Japanese audiences as well.I'm giving the film a 6 simply because the animation was nice and the film was original. But apart from that, the confusing story isn't fun, the characters aren't lovable and I think it's possibly his weakest movie."

When they arrive, they live in a nice and quiet home. In a place, were strange things did happen, and will happen, too. First of all, I have to list up what was good about the film. It was absolutely beautiful animation with great paint, drawing techniques, and amazing colors. They had that mix with painting-like animation, but at the same time, classic Japanese anime. And I really liked that, I think it is a very nice thing, and I can see that this is a technique that Studio Ghibli is using a lot, and they are really doing it well. Very nice music. It was soft, easy and quiet, but at the same time it built up a hidden suspense that was holding. The music was some sort of anxiety mixed with calmness. Very strange. Last thing that was good was the overall atmosphere and the feeling of the movie, at least in the first act. Because then things started to get a little weird. Everything became unknown and messy, the story changed the course multiple times, and I wasn't sure which way the plot was going to go. At the end everything became a little more clear, but still a little weird. When you don't know what is really going on, the action becomes a little nonsense, too. And that was exactly what happened. The action sequences were sometimes fun and entertaining, but I was still questioning: Why are they doing it? Why are they running? What are they running from? What's the point of the story? Good enough that they had a good moral at the end. Very great with a good message about the balance of the world, and that the soul value is very important. After all, this was a movie on the middle. Great music and animation. Fine atmosphere in the first act. But it got a little messy, and the story changed course to many times. They rushed a lot and I didn't get time to think.

Miyazaki builds an interesting fantasy world yet again, probably for the last time.But story telling and character development are a bit off. The narrative feels forced and not flowing naturally. In the older titles like Nausicaa, Spirited Away, or Howl's Moving Castle, strange things happen but the mystical worlds have their own rules and Miyazaki was masterful in subtly convincing us the way things worked in those worlds. But this movie has just too many things hastily cramped together and they don't have enough room to really sink in. Simply put, it's difficult to follow. The same thing goes for character development. The main protagonist (Mahito) grows up through an adventure, which is great, but his momemts of growth come abrupt and not really earned.It's a cliche by now that Miyazaki does magic, but this particular film doesn't have much of it. Strangely enough, it reminded me of Tales from Earthsea (2006) by Goro Miyazaki.

A meditation on grief and release, the film serves as Miyazaki's testament to progeny, legacy, and the world. It implores viewers not to take the world for granted, urging them to craft their own destinies. The dichotomy of cherishing true connections and relinquishing past loves echoes throughout, with an emphasis on embracing all facets of oneself.In unequivocal terms, this is Miyazaki's Opus Magnum, a cinematic zenith.

Hayao once confessed that he was long separated from his mother, and experienced air raids in his childhood. How can one live in such a world?

                    "content": "\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film \"Killers of the Flower Moon\", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10."

It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered \"medicine\" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !"

                    "content": "Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)While watching the Irishman, I remember feeling guilty about pausing to check how much time was left. This time, I was scared to look at the watch because I never leave the cinema without finishing a. Movie. I know it's Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest directors who made phenomenal movies like Taxi Driver, Wolf of Wall Street and The Departed, but honestly, Scorsese shmorsese for making this one 2 hours longer than it had to be.The story is about a tribe of Native Americans who discovered oil in Osage at the start of 20th century. Our protagonist Earnest (DiCaprio) and his uncle (De Niro) are on a mission to snatch that money for themselves. It's a nice story that could have been an 8/10 as it explores the topics of greed, colonisation and cultural erasure without any consequences. It also came out at a perfect time considering the current events, but did it have to be sooooo damn loooong?Knowing the title of the film, you automatically know it's ending so that alone saps out all the mystery. For what is supposed to be a sad story, the film doesn't create any emotional weight to make us care for it's characters and as a result, it's hard to connect with anything. De Niro and Fraser did a fine job but DiCaprio looked like a pitiful aging boar instead of the young, sly and seductive fox he was meant to be.The costumes and decorations were great but it's like they forgot about the audience while making this film. The story repeats the same trope again and again creating zero tension for us to be invested in until the final 30 minutes. Moreover, it's as if the whole cast, was injected with ketamine as they looked and sounded lethargic adding more weight to the dragging pace.If Scorsese wanted to make an impact then he should've used emotions and tension instead of 600 pauses, glances and empty conversations. He was trying to say a lot in the epilogue about tragedy being hidden behind entertainment and profit but by the time the epilogue finally came, I was happy to go home instead of being floored by the sadness. It's an important story that sadly didn't work out as an impactful drama.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews."

                    "content": "Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: \"Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it.\" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment."

After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible."

                    "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. \"King\" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the \"old\" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to \"them with the gold make the rules.\" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023."

It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film."

For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale."

First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV."

                    "content": "I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history."

                    "content": "First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious \"Ernest\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle \"King\" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, \"Mollie\" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, \"Ernest\" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more \"suitable\" owners. This sudden spate of \"accidents\" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious \"White\" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the \"King\" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - \"Mollie\" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the \"white\" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better \"Irishman\" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again."

Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one.

I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal.

When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes.

My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in \"Dredd.\" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative."

There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

It finds the legendary filmmaker at the top of his game (he's been there since 2013 it seems, with an amazing unbroken streak), telling what might be his bleakest and most emotionally distressing story yet.It was expected that a film about a series of real-life killings committed by greedy people against indigenous people was never going to be easygoing, but it's the execution here that counts. It's constant dread and an exploration of twisted, manipulative, and often downplayed evil (at least in the eyes of the evildoers) that's always in the shadows, and just hidden enough to ensure such violence continues. It disturbs and creeps up on you in ways that are difficult to anticipate or prepare oneself for.It's an exploration of the death by a thousand cuts equivalent of atrocious, systemic murder. Seeing blatant crime against a race or group of people is troubling when it's out in the open, but in depicting it as both blatant and sometimes in a more insidious and calculated way, it makes you think about how many similar cases might've happened that weren't noticed or brought to light - not just in America, but anywhere with indigenous populations. It's here where Killers of the Flower Moon isn't just powerful for the specific story being told (and it is), but for what it suggests on a broader level.It's like Shoah, in that way - the lengthy and soul-crushing Holocaust documentary from 1985 that is as much about the horrifying banality and numbing effect of great, widespread, non-stop evil as it is about laying bare what evils were committed. The pacing and length of Killers of the Flower Moon are essential to conveying these things. Having to spend so much time with this story and these troubling themes makes them all the more impactful.The film's beautifully shot, masterfully edited, and the three leads - Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, and Robert De Niro - are all deserving of awards recognition. Those who thought The Irishman dragged might feel the same here, but I thought it earned just about every minute of its 3.5 hour runtime.Complaints? DiCaprio contorts his face like a bulldog the whole movie - I only noticed at about the 2.5 hour mark, but I couldn't shake the mental image. It's still a great performance, and the character he portays here is unlike any other he's ever played. There is also a sense of creeping familiarity to parts of the final act, but some interesting turns are taken. And then the ending... the final scene and then the very last shot are both brilliant, and helped the film end on a powerful note. That being said, I do expect the final scene to be divisive. Good, I think."

People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. \"Masterpiece\" and \"a sprawling crime epic\" are just a few of the praises \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.\"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, \"Flower Moon\" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found \"Flower Moon\" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two."

It is simply far too long and the large parts of the film proceed at a snails pace.Rather like the portrayal of the Tulsa race riots at the start of the Watchmen TV series, it does shed light on an ugly slice of 20th century American history, but for a film that purports to champion the cause of the Osage people (and perhaps remind Us citizens of the plight of first nation Americans in general) it provides them with no agency at all.

Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat.

With incredible actors to tell the tale this should have been a masterpiece. It was with this in mind that I was extremely excited to watch this film.Instead Scorsese's inability to make proper cuts to his films (see The Irishman) makes an otherwise well told story a drag. Good moviemakers know how to compress good books to fit a two to two and a half hour window. He seems to have lost this ability and the result is too many redundant scenes that are repeating the same dialogue.This is especially the case with the constant manipulation between De Niro and DiCaprio, both of whom put in captivating performances even if they are inappropriately cast as characters that are supposed to be decades younger. Multiple scenes between the two could have been removed with only positive results.The ultimate conclusion to this film is predictably clear after about an hour, yet it takes well over two more hours to get there leaving much of the audience exhausted and disinterested by the end. This is such a disappointment and a disservice to this subject that I actually felt anger towards the director instead of the people who perpetrated such atrocities against the Osage people."

Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak \"dramatic\" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right.

                    "content": "Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making \"a movie about World War 2\". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."

I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."

Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."

Instead, it was just \"meh\" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."

It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the \"Will you shoot your emperor?\" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."

A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? \"You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing\"?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."

When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an \"epic\" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution.

But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a \"highlights\" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except \"oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.\"The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie.

It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused \"coward\" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any \"funny\" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut.

No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer?

Scott decides to focus on three specific aspects of Napoleon's life and personality to show who he thinks Napoleon was at the expense of omitting much of what makes him such a fascinating figure in history.The first aspect Scott focuses on is Napoleon the lover. Much of this film shows his infatuation and on-again off-again relationship with Josephine. Both actors handle their parts well and while there is some humor and tension, it is the least interesting part of the movie. Still, some focus is necessary as his marriage to Josephine was certainly a key aspect of his life.The second aspect is Napoleon the megalomaniac. We all know of Napoleon as the short guy who had insecurity issues. Even if there is truth to this, it is probably an overstatement, but there is no denying the massive ego of the man. In many respects his ego is understandable for all he accomplished, and Scott paints Napoleon's inflated belief in himself as the reason for his fall, particularly in his invasion of Russia. Scott does not want us the think Napoleon fights for the glory of France but rather for the glory of Napoleon.The final side of the Napoleon casts him as a butcher. Towards the end of his career we see Napoleon recklessly spending the lives of his men as he seeks to conquer for himself. The movie leaves us with a comprehensive death toll that Napoleon left in his wake, a massive number that comes as a result of his callous disregard for his own men and endless ambition.So then we are left with a Napoleon as a man who loved Josephine, who had a massive ego, and constantly warred, causing the deaths of millions. All this is true, but what of Napoleon the tactician? What of Napoleon the reformer? What of Napoleon the leader? Scott focused on the worst aspects of Napoleon to highlight while disregarding the best. I was shocked that more was not discussed and shown over the massive victories and the unprecedented tactics he employed that make him a general still studied in military academies today. He was a multifaceted man, who accomplished much good and much bad, but he comes off in this film as a little ambitious fool.The film also seems jumbled at times and jumps forward in ways that show Napoleon must be conquering and doing something right, but he goes from general, to consul, to emporer in quick ways we are not shown. He beats Austria and Russa, befriends Russia, then is back at war with them one scene later. I understand the politics, battles, and alliances are hard to follow of the ealry 19th century, but I left feeling like I learned little more about Napoleon and the France he ruled than I already knew coming in.Despite the films shortcomings, it is a genuinely effective movie and shot beautifully. The battle scenes are bloody and tense, and the costumes and sets look recreate Napoleonic France beautifully."

To do that Scott basically lies through the whole movie.Nothing has happened like it's in the movie. Not even the battles. In a battle we see Napoleon butchering all the austrians on ice. Never happened. We also see Napoleon to butcher unarmed civilians in Paris. Never happened. We see the russian tsar as a cool kid who defeated Napoleon. Yeah Napoleon lost many man due to famine and diseases. But the movie \"forget\" to highlight that the tsar sacrificed his own citizens just to hunger Napoleon. He burned his own cities and grain fields to make Napoleon unable to feed his men. All in all the tsar destroyed his own population to stop Napoleon. But the movie portrays him as a charming kid and Napoleon as some kind of monster...Not to mention the law and justice system Napoleon established. Code Civil brought equality to all the people in France. Half of the world adopted it. Basically it is the root of nowadays justice system. He demolished noble privileges and gave people equal rights. Not surprising the movie not even mentions these facts. It was way more important to show one more bizarre unpleasing sex scene.This movie is a disgusting attempt to discredit Napoleon. It's a selfish disgrace from an English director who must have been frustrated by France's greatest leader."

Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!!

In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon.

Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary."

Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray\" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews. Like, what were you watching!?"

                    "content": "I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, \"What am I missing?\" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, \"There's more?\" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10 Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."

                    "content": "In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead."

The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment."

None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time."

Like she never even existed!But then Highbotton's words rang clear: mystery has a way of driving people mad. If we the audience were this frustrated, imagine just how delirious it must've made Snow. She could've outed him, betrayed him, stood up to him, maybe even messaged him- he must've searched for her if just to get rid of the last loose end (before he became too powerful to even bother with this anymore, of course), but he found absolutely nothing! Nothing to chase, nothing to hate, nothing to even confirm that it was real other than his fading memories, white roses and a ghost of her who with the same spirit sings that damn song under the hanging tree.I can't help but think that what if she'd stayed? He'd lied, and he had violence, and all those other bad things in his being already, but the only thing that was keeping him from going through that door was Lucy gray. It doesn't excuse nor explain his action (not even by the slightest) but I can't help but wonder if she'd stayed, would he still turn out that way? Not necessarily the whole tyrannical dictator coming into power stuff- but fundamentally could he have become a better human being? Could he have changed? And was her departure his sign to finally cave in, or was he going to turn out like that anyway?Also the hunger games were freaking crazy I loved every second of it, favorite part of the movie.

It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a \"mentor\" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10."

This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12."

Probably the biggest problem is that none of the main characters seem likable or realistic enough in the world for me to root for them or have the emotional down-spiral of the characters to be a good tragic drama.There is sort of this 1950s steampunk aesthetic that also made no sense to me given that this is supposed to take place in our distance future rather than the somewhat recent past. How/why would TVs in the future start to become anything like TV screens from the 50s? Are they also going to reinvent laserdiscs?The way the hunger games unfolds makes it feel completely absurd that the winner would win even with all of the cheating. Also the 2 big dramatic scenes after the games just seems confusing. Especially intermixed with some of the other scenes around them. Maybe he works better with all of the perspectives and time that an author is given in a book. But it certainly didn't make a lot of sense to me.Stumbling across the guns later in the film seemed way too coincidental too. And the motivations of the main characters was so inconsistent from one moment to the next near the end that he started to seem bipolar and phycho. I don't think they sufficiently developed his character so one could understand why/how he would work so hard for power and control. The beginning had him challenged that power and control so much that it was a wonder why he would even want any power and control over a society that he just barely seemed to care about.All in all. It's a mess, but interesting to try to follow because it seems to be such a mess.The actors seemed alright. The music was good. The cinematography was fine. But the story and characters didn't seem well developed to me.

Everything from the introduction of the Games to evasions to conclusions were well executed. Despite the film being violent prone it still comes across as tense and deadly without showing anything too gruesome to maintain its PG rating.The acting was strong. The actors were well suited for their roles, and only based on trailers, I found the young Snow builds well for the original movies, but unknown for certain. I loved the chemistry between Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth.The music was terrific. Zegler has an amazing voice, and her songs obviously work well into the film. The visuals are mostly incredible. There's a few spots where it's very obviously screen acting. Part of me hopes they did have physical sets cause there were portions that felt genuine.Overall, you don't need to have seen the previous films to understand what's going on, but it may help to better understand who the characters are. Acting is strong, music is great, and the story is amazing enough to make me want to see the rest of \"The Hunger Games\".That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

the direction on a microscale was bad as the interpersonal scenes did not feel fluid at all and were not well executed; the direction of actors was bad as none of of the performances felt like they were elevated by direction; storytelling was poor as there doesn't feel like a sense of where the movie is going as builds to one thing and drastically disposes of it in favor of a something else), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Tom Blyth (Shows some range of emotion and shows both the good and the bad side of Snow decently well), Pretty Bad from Rachel Zegler (Her accent kept on slipping and she kinda feels out of place with the rest of the cast (and the chemistry between her and Blyth is not the best); her musical moments (while forced) were carried out well as she shows off how good of a singer she is), Pretty Good from Peter Dinklage (Really just feels like he is playing many of the characters he has played in the past (the drunk character who has a lot to say) so he kinda just goes on his own), Good from Jason Schwartzman (The best performance of the movie as he plays the comedic relief character well), Pretty Bad from Hunter Schafer (Very emotionless and doesn't have any emotion with Blyth), Decent from Josh Andrés Rivera (Has moments where he shines and some moments where it feels like he's overacting), Decent from Viola Davis (Not really her best performance as it is a lot of overacting (but it doesn't feel like it is a bad performance, just not the best direction)), Decent from the rest of the cast (Hard to comment as most of the cast is child actors who feel like they weren't given the best direction)), Bad Story (The concept was pretty good as it was interesting to see the early Hunger Games and the origins of President Snow (though the carrying out of this concept was very bad); the story contruction was terrible as first act drags so much that its boring and the third act is completely out of place as it felt like they forgot to make Snow the bad guy (the second act is pretty good as its just The Hunger Games and plays to the strengths of the franchise); storytelling/flow between sequences was bad as every scene just felt forced and nothing felt like it flowed between each other (and this is especially seen in the final act as the movie has to make up for making Snow be the good guy when hes supposed to be the bad guy; character writing was very bad (Snow is terribly written as they put so much emphasis on sympathiszing him and making him be the good guy that they run out of time in making him be the bad guy and rush/force this part of the character in the end, Lucy Gray Baird is not written either as you really don't cate about her as her singing just gets really annoying towards the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue did not flow and was kinda forced; the tension build was good and carried out well in The Hunger Games act; the symbolism was very shallow as it does not do a good job in building Snow's journey for power; the foreshadowing was none-existent as the movie forces the ending because they forgot to make Snow the bad guy in the first two acts), Good Score (Carries different motifs from the original franchise), Good Cinematography (Helped show how grand the capital was and helped build the world (especially in The Hunger Games)), Good Sound (Helped in the action scenes), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helped make the movie feel like it was a part of the franchise and did not feel over-the-top in any way), Good Production Design (Helped with building the world), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as 2 out of the three acts were pointless (the first act builds Snow to be a good guy and really drags, the second act is pretty good as it is just The Hunger Games, and the third act is just so forced as it clearly shows that they forgot to make Snow the bad guys so they rush to give him moments that show how he's not a good person); The movie could've been split into two movies to help with runtime (with the entire third act being spun off to show how bad of a person Snow is as there are some moments in the second act that could allude to him being a bad guy, something a second movie could take and build on), Pacing was slow in the first and third act (especially in the third) but pretty good in the second act as the fast pace helped build tension in The Hunger Games, Climax was so underwhelming it was more laughable than entertaining, Tone was very similar to other Hunger Games movies."

None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters. It's a mediocre film that doesn't deviate from the franchise's standards. It's not the worst, it's not the best. It is a film that becomes forgettable."

It is not clear if they wanted to show a specific edition of the hunger games, if they wanted to explore Lucy and the other tributes, if they wanted to tell the story from Snow's perspective or if they wanted to explain how the modern hunger game came to life. The film it's all over the places, characters are not explored nor do they make an effort to allow the viewer to empathize with them, they're so empty and unlikable.If this is not enough they even sing. Lucy Grey straight out from the arena, after seeing the death of 24plus people is on a stage singing like a mermaid. And the singing goes on and on to the point where I can confidently sai that the last 30 minutes the film become a musical.The only likable character is portrayed by Dinklage and he dies."

Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come one!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater.

Acting was okay but none of the actors had chemistry, the stakes didn't feel very high at any point, and the singing was both excessive and borderline comical in timing. The movie preached many times that viewers need someone to root for and someone to hate, whilst simultaneously doing the exact opposite by giving us neither.What made the original Hunger Games great was that you believed in the characters backstories, and you could get drawn into it. Snow and Casca felt real, but everyone else somehow felt like a caricature of a person. Kudos to both of these actors who did a phenomenal job, it just somehow wasn't cohesive with the other characters who felt somewhat 2-dimensional.Lucy in particular felt over-acted and I struggled to root for her - the chemistry with Snow falling particularly flat. Did I mention the singing was insanely overdone? In contrast, the brief screen time that Clemensia and Snow shared felt far more genuine and intriguing, and I would've liked to understand her and Snow's friendship more.Overall the movie felt messy and lacking in heart. I had been so excited for this movie for so long and was disappointed at how disconnected it felt. Whilst I understand that singing is woven throughout the book, this felt like one of those things that in a movie felt out of place. Perhaps it was the way it was acted, I'm not sure, but even as low budget as the 1st Hunger Games movie was.... I felt connected to the characters and their journey, which was not the case here."

I read the original trilogy but never got around to reading the prequel but decided to just see the movie. Rachel Zegler receives hate because of a comment she made about a completely different movie (Snow White), and it's completely irrelevant to this movie. She performed more than beautifully in this role. She is a classically trained soprano, and was singing beautifully in her chest voice and with a really good twangy accent (which is more of a mezzo/alto type of singing in this case). From one classically-trained singer with a degree in music who performs for a living to everyone out there afraid to give this movie a chance because of all of this biases against this young woman- SHE IS GOOD! This girl is talented, and the hate is stupid.This movie was by no means perfect, but it was really good. I would have thought it was a perfect 10 if the action was better paced. It was nothing on her part. Definitely not as good as Catching Fire (the peak of the series to me), but better than both of the Mockingjays! Give it a shot without a bias of this young women in your mind and you just might find yourself enjoying it ;)"

I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of \"The Photograph (2020),\" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie."

It's an insanely thought provoking movie of the treatment of black stories in Hollywood and in novelizations, but it also talks about the categorization of Black People in the Caucasian perspective. I thought the actual direction and acting were very good throughout the film (not Oscar worthy but good), but i found the actual screenplay to not go as deep as it needed to, nor did it try too hard with the substance when it comes in context to the shapement of Black voices in a Caucasian-driven hollywood.

                    "content": "Cord Jefferson's American Fiction is a satire about an African American novelist who criticizes the industry that restricts Black storytelling to trauma and poverty narratives. The film is a response to the rise of social movements like #BlackLivesMatters and #OscarsSoWhite, which often focus on traumatic violence and provide white liberals with an outlet to empathize with suffering. However, making a movie as a response to industry limitations can limit the movie's intention. Cord Jefferson, a TV writer on Succession and Master of None, delivers a superb feature debut, filled with snappy banter and gags, with a masterful ensemble cast including Jeffrey Wright, Sterling K Brown, and Tracee Ellis Ross. Jefferson adapts Percival Everett's 2001 novel Erasure into a thorny existential character drama about a writer who feels unseen but never makes himself vulnerable enough for people to truly see him. Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison is the professor who pulls a Bamboozled by cynically writing a novel filled with pandering cliches and tropes about Black struggle that salivating white gatekeepers line up to make it a sensational hit. The success does little to alter Monk's disgruntled and bewildered state.Jefferson's film is wisely critical of Monk and society the author is railing against. There is a strain of self-hate in the character, who is regularly ridiculed for his taste for white wine and white women. Monk copes with micro-aggressions in the office and on the street while insisting in the most blatant self-delusional ways that he doesn't believe in race. When Monk sees a best-selling novel called We's Lives in Da Ghetto celebrated by the literary establishment for its Precious-like storytelling, he attends a panel where the author Sintara Golden, played generously by Issa Rae, is code-switching to entertain her mostly white audience. On a lark, Monk writes his own hood novel under a pseudonym, which would snuggly fit into the 50 Cent movie Get Rich or Die Tryin'. The movie almost gets away from Jefferson during outrageously funny moments, as actors like Adam Brody play up the industry's ignorance and craven exploitation of marginalized voices to the point of parody. The festival audience was howling, likely because few feel implicated in such interactions. \"American Fiction\" is a satire directed by Cord Jefferson, based on Percival Everett's novel, Erasure. The film explores the dilemma of making entertainment that criticizes it, as it can easily fall prey to its own pitfalls. The film is grounded by the family melodrama and warm interactions between Monk and his siblings, allowing the Black characters to escape the world's perception of them. The film follows Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison, a struggling writer who becomes fed up with \"lesser\" books that pander to white people through stereotypical hood narratives. Monk decides to write a fake book, initially titled \"My Pafology\" and later re-titled the F word,\" which is so stereotyped that it mirrors the corrupt tastes of the white literary establishment. Despite expecting the novel to fail spectacularly, it becomes a raging success, leading to a major book deal and a movie option."

A huge one.Not painted on the large cinematic canvases of its likely Best Picture competitors like \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Barbie,\" \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" or \"Poor Things,\" director-co-writer Cord Jefferson's wise comedy scores its bull's-eyes on a life-size target, somewhere between the heart and the brain. The writing is brilliantly original, coming at well-worn black racial themes with eyes so fresh, you feel like you're seeing the subject for the first time.Jeffrey Wright carries the film, showing a side of himself often missing from past powerhouse dramatic performances. He's lovable ... despite the fact that his character doesn't know how to be. His Thelonius Ellison - you can call him \"Monk\" - is a prickly, Harvard-educated California university literature professor, author of several novels that no one, other than adoring academic critics, read.Earning its audacious title, \"American Fiction's\" plot is as well crafted as its metaphors. Before it's finished, black stereotypes and tone-deaf white efforts to embrace them have fallen under its satirical scalpel. So have the worlds of academia, publishing and Hollywood moviemaking. Its humor is smart and sly. It's no coincidence that Monk shares his last name with author Ralph Ellison, whose \"Invisible Man\" helped usher in the black American literary renaissance of the '50s and '60s.While its satire is spot on, at its heart the movie is really about family. Turns out Monk isn't the only \"doctor\" in his family. His sister Lisa (Tracee Ellis Ross) and brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) are physicians. The Ellisons are upscale enough to have a beach house as well as their big family home where matriarch Agnes (Leslie Uggams) is in the early stages of Alzheimer's All that brain power doesn't make them any less dysfunctional than other families. They just have wittier things to say about it.After Monk is drawn back to his family roots in Boston, his writing career takes an unexpected turn. What starts as a prank protest of \"authentic\" portrayals of black people in mainstream culture - notably by overnight-sensation black novelist Sintara Golden (Issa Rae) - inadvertently transforms Monk into a caricature himself. Which, to his dismay, is the path to the literary glory he has spent his life chasing.\"The dumber I behave, the richer I get,\" he complains to his agent (John Ortiz). (This isn't a spoiler - it's in the trailer.) Considering how intelligent the script is, it's ironic that a single word plays a crucial, and hilarious, role summing things up. You know the word - the one that begins with \"F.\" Watching \"American Fiction\" is richly rewarding, punctuated by laugh-out-loud moments steeped in real affection for its gently flawed characters. It has already picked up wins at early film festivals; expect plenty more nominations all around its cast and creators as awards season cranks into high gear.Its rich vein of empathy and compassion make for magnificent fiction. It truly is a work of literature as much as genius filmmaking.Watching it, I found myself uttering out loud, that word I mentioned above.For me it wasn't a curse at all, but a spontaneous expression of admiration, awe and pure joy."

The script is sprightly, with interweaving narratives and metanarratives, with the central character writing a story within a story, which soon develops into a film within a film. That sounds as though it might be pretentiously arty, but it isn't at all. It's often very funny. But because there is a central story of great poignancy, led tenderly by Leslie Uggams, as the protagonist's mother, and Myra. Lucretia Taylor as her longtime help and friend, the movie as a whole is less daunting, and therefore perhaps less challanging, then a piece by, say, Charlie Kauffman, who might have been much more astringent with the same material. So, less austere than it might have been, but intelligent all the same, compassionate and entertaining. The cast is excellent throughout. Jeffery Wright, who is a wonderful actor, really ought to get an Oscar nomination for his work in the central role, but the Academy never recognises fine acting in anything other than Grand movies.

From one who watches too many movies every year, I'm amazed this film is the work of a director making his feature film directorial debut. Writer-director Cord Jefferson was one of the lead writers for the excellent series \"Master of None\", and he has adapted the 2001 novel \"Erasure\" by Percival Everett for the big screen. It's a brilliant satire and commentary on a society that has twisted things to the point where no one knows what to say or how to say it.The film opens with a college professor pushing back on a student's overly emotional reaction to his use of a certain word in class. What strikes us in the scene is that the professor is black and the student is white. The confrontation costs Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison (the always great Jeffrey Wright) his job at a New England university, and perfectly sets the stage for the rest of the story - much of which centers on Monk's incredulity at the progression of events around him.Without a steady teaching paycheck, Monk heads to his see his agent Arthur (well-known character actor John Ortiz), who informs that his most recent intellectual book has no market, and suggests he write something a bit more mainstream. Monk heads to the Boston book festival and hears author Sintara Golden (comedian Issa Rae, BARBIE) in a public reading of a particularly stereotypical excerpt from her latest best-seller, purported to telling \"black stories, our stories\". Monk simply can't believe there is an audience for this or that it passes for black representation.On a lark, Monk sits down to crank out a \"black\" story by a black writer. He does so as a joke, and is shocked, and a bit annoyed, that a publisher comes back with a huge offer. The negotiations with the publisher are hilarious. We see two white professionals desperate to offer a cool black book, yet so afraid to say the wrong thing (something offensive), that they inexplicably agree to Monk's terms ... changing the title to an unpublishable curse word. As a bonus, Monk has published the book under the pseudonym Stagg R. Lee (a takeoff on the classic Lloyd Price song). The publishing deal requires Monk to assume the identity of a wanted fugitive as part of the backstory for marketing purposes. When the movie offer rolls in, Monk is again beside himself, and states, \"the dumber I act, the richer I get.\" While all this is going on, Monk is also facing some struggles in his personal life with his mother (80 year old Leslie Uggams, \"Roots\") who is struggling with dementia, his financially-strapped sister Lisa (Tracee Ellis Ross, Diana's daughter, THE HIGH NOTE, 2020), and brother Cliff (Sterling K Brown, WAVES, 2019, \"This is Us\") whose recent divorce was caused by his revealing his preference for a gay lifestyle. All of this for a family whose dad committed suicide years ago. In the midst of all the family and professional drama, Monk strikes up a relationship with Coraline (Erika Alexander, GET OUT, 2017), a neighbor across the street, though he can't bring himself to come clean with this latest publishing scheme.The best comedies have something to say, and the best satires are often quite cynical as they expose the absurdity of our world. Monk is dumbfounded at many of the same things that dumbfound us, and this peaks at his meeting with an aptly named movie producer, Wiley Valdespino (played by Adam Brody, READY OR NOT, 2019). Myra Lucretia Taylor (THE BIG SICK, 2017) has a supporting role as the housekeeper, and there are too many terrific scenes to count. One of the best is a debate between Monk and Sintara, and the writing is priceless and brilliant. An intelligent man like Monk cannot wrap his head around the fact that black books pandering to white readers who are trying to follow the rules is the new path to success. Filmmaker Cord Jefferson delivers the message (warning?) in a smart, funny movie featuring a wonderful lead performance by Jeffrey Wright.Opening in theaters nationwide on December 22, 2023."

Jeffrey Wright, who's normally seen as an enjoyable supporting actor, takes the helm of this film and leads it convincingly. His character's repeated desire to be seen and validated is opposite from the crafty, suspenseful roles that I'm used to seeing from Wright, which became more impressive as the character's vulnerabilities started to flesh out. The film asks an important question that seems to be embedded within the larger scope of social commentary. \"Why do you do what you do? And, why do you feel the way you feel based on what you do?\" There's a psychological battle between doing something because it's \"good\" vs. Doing something because it provides opportunities, and then there's the sliver of possibility to intertwine the two of them. The family dynamic is the emotional crux of this story, showcasing moments that are abruptly raw and realistic while using connection as the focal point of transformation in Wright's character arc. The story is sharp, clever, and aware of the message that it's trying to share. In comparison to films with similar intentions, \"American Fiction\" leans heavily on the satirical tone to explore race and identity while visibly using comedy to approach the subject as universally as possible."

It doesn't manage to spark into life, arguably the most forgettable Disney characters to date.I've read several comments about the animation, and plenty seem to applaud the style, quality and colours, let me be honest, this sucks, the most basic and unimaginative animation I think I've seen, to me it looks unfinished, did they get it out in a rush, or were there budget cuts, this isn't Disney standard, let alone a Centenary special.I genuinely fear for Disney, everything they're touching seems to be going to pot, they need a major shake up, Snow White doesn't look like a classic, where do Disney go from this?Woeful.4/10."

                    "content": "Wish is a funny, perhaps unfortunate title for this movie. When its trailer came out, and people commented on how its \"storybook illustrations come to life\" visual style looked more like unfinished 3D animation than moving drawings, you bet there were puns aplenty about how this is just \"Spider-Verse from Wish\" -- or, more aptly, \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish from Wish\" but that one sounds a bit clunky.Indeed, for all the talk of how Wish would be a grand return for Disney Fairy Tales™ that also, I guess to commemorate Disney's centennial, would somehow \"personify\" the wishing star we see in many of their films, the reception wasn't exactly across-the-board ecstatic. On top of how weird the animation looked to people -- which is odd since we know Disney can nail 2D-looking 3D, as with 2013's The Paperman -- several critics remarked on how a lot of the post-2010 Disney movies (Pixar, too) reduce themselves to \"Pick a culture to explore; make generational trauma the villain\" and, more importantly, have interchangeable adorkable/awkward/\"quirky\" female protagonists that oft sound more like Millennial YouTubers than fairy tale heroines.Ever since Tangled, the new \"princesses\" have tried to replicate the vibe of Mandy Moore's Rapunzel on some level. Wish also exemplifies that weird trend of post-Tangled Disney/Pixar films of having one-word titles that don't sound very whimsical or exciting. (Kudos to DALLEE 3: It tends to get this right when generating fake posters for \"Pixar's *INSERT HISTORICAL ATROCITY HERE*\".) If they ever adapt H. C. Andersen's The Princess and the Pea, mark my words that it'll just be named Pea.The plot: The ruler of the Mediterranean kingdom of Rosas, King Magnifico, has the magical ability to keep the \"wishes\" of the populace in his custody to grant/return as he sees fit; each citizen has to give theirs up as they come of age. His new apprentice, Asha, senses that evil is afoot and discovers that she is able to make wishes irrespective of the king's approval, turning towards the stars and even summoning a sentient wishing star named... Star. And yes, the plushie should be in stores now.Ariana DeBose, Chris Pine, and Alan Tudyk, who naturally plays the comic animal sidekick, are all fairly funny in their roles from time to time and I may even have vibed with one of the songs. Sadly, my verdict mirrors the one that everyone else seems to have: I will not be remembering this movie in a few weeks, beyond the myriad jokes at its expense.I suppose the Wish situation might partly be explained by the awakening that's been happening all throughout 2023, where mainstream movies get to be truly good and artful again, and so people realize that Disney's films may not be all that interesting -- and, moreover, may not be worth defending under pretenses of activism. We are more aware than ever that options exist. Even if you truly refuse to bring back 2D animation and opt to meet people halfway by making a sort of 2D-3D hybrid, we can find more seamless attempts in such movies as Klaus (which is also a better call-back to older Disney designs than this is) and, like I said, the Spider-Verse films.I do think people act a bit dismissive toward the picture, and there are things to appreciate in it -- particularly its storybook opening sequence that mimics the typography of the one from Snow White; other images recall the likes of Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Pocahontas, etc. Alas, I think the best version of the movie was lost to another timeline where less corporate meddling took place. (Did I mention that the songs were written, not by someone with experience in musicals, but by a person who's written songs for Justin Bieber?)We should also give Wish this, however: It made droves of people, be they fans (the thinking, non-zealous kind) or film critics, truly appreciate what this studio used to give us, especially during the Disney Renaissance -- from the superior emotional resonance of the songs to the heavy stakes and grandiloquent visuals (most notably in Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame), not to mention the variety of the 2D-animated styles compared to now, when most of the movies look like they inhabit pretty much the same universe.If you want a true celebration of Disney's magic over the past century 'til now, I'd rather you check out the Disney+ short Once Upon A Studio (which I managed to enjoy despite being reminded not two days later of what Disney has become, as they announced another slew of remakes, even one of effing Frozen). Asha, the latest addition to the world of Disney princesses, joining hands with Snow White, the first-ever of the princesses, is significantly more poetic and moving than anything in Wish."

But as of late, each Disney project has come to feel like a rehash of every other Disney project; slowly killing any amount of excitement one might have looking forward to each new project.Wish is no different and is as every bit forgettable and uninspiring as people are accusing it of being. If there's anything worth remembering though, it would have to be the watercolor-esque art style, but not even that justifies the movie's existence. Wish lacks depth and is painfully a face-value movie. It has a Disney-protagonist, a Disney-antagonist, a Disney-merch mascot, some Disney-music, and well yea, that's about it.The question though, is if kids would enjoy it. After all, that's who the movie is primarily aimed at. And the answer might be 'yes', but probably at a level no different than how they might enjoy say Cocomelon or something. There's nothing magical that might stand out and nothing that might inspire. It's yet another Disney showcase of good animation with less than nothing else to accommodate."

There are some good musical instrumental backgrounds as well. I do appreciate that the story isn't based on a sequel, remake or something that already exists and Disney tries to introduce new characters and settings. But the issue is that the narrative is way too familiar from other stories and it lacks the creativity, energy and charm of the good old Disney princess movies which makes it pretty difficult to fully engage with emotionally or to care for. The lack of energy and bland style causes the characters to not be investing as well since none of the characters were engaging or interesting at all. However, the voice performances from the cast members are pretty good. Ariana DeBose and Chris Pine both provided really good voice performances. Including Alan Tudyk as Tudyk is great as usual with his voice works.The animation, as I mentioned, it's solid as the design models, colors, and movements are pretty good. With the animation using a mix of computer and watercolor, there are some really nice moments but admittedly, there were some animated movements or looks that felt odd, bland and slightly distracting. The dialogue is pretty clunky, the direction was boring, and the singing or musical moments, despite one or two songs being not too bad, the singing and song-writing wasn't good as some of the sound felt like it was written from AI. Like some of the voice and singing sound effects were pretty off. And as a whole, it was mostly boring.For this being the 100th Anniversary movie for Disney, it's quite embarrassing since there could have been any other movie that could have been pretty fun and all but it seemed Disney decided to go with the bland route.Overall, children and families will be entertained but this one is definitely one of Disney's weaker movies."

She's enough of a cypher to let anyone put themselves in her place.The villain is a blandly handsome king whose motivations boil down to \"worship me\" and \"more power.\" He lacks the complexity of Frollo or Gothel, and the charisma of Scar or Ursula. He's empty enough that you can imagine him as an analogue for whatever politician you dislike.The supporting cast was a pile of generic stock characters. Ably enough acted, but utterly forgettable. None were developed enough to be interesting.The music is lively, but instantly forgettable. After Frozen, Tangled, and Moana, my kids sang garbled toddler versions of the songs on the ride home. After Wish? Nothing. Not even a hum.The art was interesting. The watercolor-ish style worked for the backgrounds, and captured some of the feel of classic Disney films. But the characters seemed crudely pasted atop the background. More than any recent Disney film, you could FEEL the computers behind the animation.The plot was uninspired. There were a handful of places where the writers could have taken different paths, and asked interesting questions about the nature of power and responsibility, but they abandoned them in favor of a one-dimensional and utterly predictable story.Even the worst flops in the Disney archives had something going for them. Brother Bear was beautiful, Home on the Range was funny, and Dinosaur was a technological leap forward. Wish has nothing. Was it terrible? No. Was it memorable? Definitely not.

I expected the struggle to grant everyone's wishes would lead to undesired outcome that the girl would have to fix. In doing so becoming the villain herself as her selfishness would have brought disaster and I thought the king would be proved right and the girl's selfishness would lead to the king sacrificing himself to save everyone. Teaching the girl a lesson about stealing and maintain order. It would have been a good twist if the initial villain ended up being the good guy after all and the girls action would make her the villain. Then there could have been a redemption arc for her in the final act. The Star could have been some type of neutral being that ended up becoming evil due to all the negative wishes overpowering the good wishes. Then there could have been that one pure heart wish that overpowered all the bad wishes and restoring the stars position to either neutral or good. The premise was there. It could have been so good. But none of that happened.In this movie the girl is perfect she cannot do any wrong. She has no hero's journey. Everyone in the story is perfect except the main villain and he wouldn't have been corrupted if not for the girls actions. What she did to him was basically entrapment. I lesson I got from this movie is stealing is ok if it's for family. No one is capable of making bad wishes. Which is not true. If I was or anyone had the power to grant wishes we too would be worried about handing out wishes like candy. I think any one with common sense would know how dangerous that can be. What ever happened to the old school Disney movies That had consequences for your actions. Those were some real lessons. The queens actions in the end are criminal. The king never imprisoned any one. He never robbed them of their freedom but she did. She basically sentenced him to die. For guarding wishes.The star thing was cute tho. That thing is going to sell merchandise. The animation was good. The songs won't be classics. They're forgettable. The only characters that have good design are the king and the star."

After all those years hammering the message into our heads, they have forgotten it themselves! And that is one of the many issues with Wish. There's no love interest, and we, the audience, lose interest.Maybe we shouldn't. Maybe we should appreciate that love for your grandpa and your mom is enough, and that friendship with your buddies is equally important as passionate love. Or maybe Disney could make peace with love. When a young person loves another, it doesn't necessarily mean that they need to let go of their personality, ambitions, ideals or for that matter, wishes. Love can be, usually is, a good thing.Making an emotional story without love is not impossible, but it's hard. And the ingredients are not there in Wish. In the absence of love, humor can help. But the secondary characters in Wish, Valentino the goat or the mute lucky star, are not very good, and not funny at all. The music could help, but the songs aren't all that memorable. And the main characters, while decent, can't quite carry the story. Asha, a mix of Moana, Elsa and Pocahontas, is okay but she seems to lack a clear purpose that is believable, and we never really care much about her. Magnifico, the villain, may be the best character, but he feels so much like a rehash of other villains before him, that we struggle to see him as a character in his own right.Left without emotion, without humor, without great music, the film doubles down on weaponry, raising the stakes on the use of dark magic with every scene to try and keep the audience awake. But it's not enough. I dozed off a few times.My advice to Disney: make love, not war."

I remember taking my young kids to the annual Disney blockbuster movie - they were all excellent. But current creative staff aren't that creative and are making movies that nobody wants to see.The story is very generic and the songs, by pop singer-songwriter Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, are rather uninspiring. But I have to admit that DeBose and Pine performed the generic songs well. The only time Wish shines bright is when it dares to get a little bit odd. Asha wishes on a star for everyone in Rosas to get their wish (so that they can work toward making them come true for themselves), and a plump, wiggly and mischievous star pops out of the sky and pays her a visit, sprinkling stardust on plants and inanimate objects, bringing them to dancing, singing life.The real test was that my grandkids were bored instead of being inspired.

I didn't care for the overused \"im so awkward and quirky\" trope on the main character. Also, while I typically love Disney songs, a lot of the songs/lyrics felt super verbose. I read one review that said the songs sounded like they were generated using AI, and while I don't know if that's necessarily true, I can definitely see what they mean. Kids will like it, it's a decent family movie, but it's not anything I need to watch twice. In my opinion, Disney has set a pretty high standard with its past films (Ratatouille, Tangled, Cars, the list goes on and on) and this one doesn't even come close to that standard. Onward is way better than Wish, maybe check that one out instead if you haven't already and are in the mood for a Disney movie. Just my opinion! My bf and I both give this one a 6.5/10."

There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of \"showing\" the character beats like older films, we are \"told\" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring \"adorkable\" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no \"Be Our Guest,\" \"Part of your World,\" \"Let it Go\" or \"We Don't Talk about Bruno\".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song \"I'm a Star\" in the movie is \"in this universe we are all shareholders.\" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film."

He had plot significance?\" That was my reaction to a lot of the movie.My second reaction was \"UUUGH!\" It feels like the people behind the scenes cared more about the audience going \"oh hey it's (insert Disney movie)!\" instead of going \"Oh my gosh! What's gonna happen next in this movie?\" Every time I saw a Disney reference or a \"hidden\" Mickey, I was cringing on the inside. It wasn't smart. It was annoying.Speaking of annoying, I had a mild dislike for Asha. There's an excellent video online about the \"adorkable\" Disney princesses. Asha feels like how gen z kids picture millennials but cranked to 100. Every time she was rambling like \"Oh I'm sorry. I'm so annoying and I care too much! Am I annoying?

This fits the current counter cultural rebels who have been running Disney behind the scenes for the last 3-4 years making sure nothing that comes out is a hit or at the very least moves products off of shelves.Is South Park right? I feel like they may know a lot more about what is really going on at Disney than anyone else at this point.You can probably just skip this one and just know that Disney is currently trying to blow up the mold of \"Wish Capitalism\" and remove itself from being such a huge part of generations of families. It's like the efforts to take control of oil companies just to run them into the ground at a huge loss but for the benefit of future generations. That is what Wish depicts in fairytale format.Disney over the last decade will at some point be a fascinating case study in American Consumer Culture and Counter Revolutionary Thought, and with this latest move I think Wish is setting itself up as the perfect teaching example.Wish is really brilliant but not in a way that families are going to want to watch - which in itself is the real point of the movie."

It's not the best thing Disney has done but it's far from the worst.Getting the negatives out of the way: despite the fairy tale setting, all the characters talk and act very modern. The second song (\"At All Costs\") really feels like they went Jukebox Musical for a bit as it's only tangentially connected with what's happening on screen. In fact all the songs have the weird quality that, while they sound good in themselves, they don't feel like they're from the same movie. For celebrating Disney's 100 years, I wish they'd included at least some traditional animation.But here's why I can't hate this film: I love the subtext of it. It's all about rebellion against stifling authority. And how the combined strength of the many can overcome even the most powerful evils. The defeat of the villain was one of my favorite moments of Disney in years. I just wish the movie lead up to it better.Perhaps it being the 100th anniversary movie put to many demands on it. So many little references to past movies went over my head while watching it. Even the obvious one of each of Asha's friends being a reference to one of the seven dwarfs. Maybe if they'd let the film be its own thing and not a celebration of all that had come before it would have been better.I recommend it. But don't set your expectations too high."

                    "content": "LIKES:The Animation -Disney knows how to make things flow, a studio that can capitalize on their swollen budget and invest in making such engaging movements.-Anatomical accuracy is captured well, animals moving about with correct form, only straying to human dimensions in a small amount when necessary.-It flows and moves in a poetic style, with a dynamic energy to match the magic being cast in this movie. And the color that goes with it starts to feel like something out of Fantasia in terms of splendor and flow.-All in all, the animation still continues to prove Disney's elite level of making the unreal come to life in a way, and give us a treat for the eyes.The Voice Work -Animation relies on voice actors to bring characters to life, and our crew has managed to bring a cornucopia of talent that helps this feat.-Tudyk is still as fun as ever. His versatility is incredible, this time making a baby goat with a smooth velvety voice his primary objective. He accomplished much with his direction, delivering some great lines to appeal to many ages.-Pine sounds like, well Pine. His voice is perfect for the illustrious king, very poignant, charming, exciting, and yet still holding hints of rough nature. He pretty much is playing a generic Disney role and doesn't quite have the flair, but also is no slouch.-DeRose as Asha is great. A modern princess take, with a sensational voice that shows control over emotion, pitch, and delivery, I liked the work she granted the latest princess.The Design -It's an odd style, but I liked the blend of 2d and 3d animation styles into this hybrid granting an almost cell-shaded game like approach.-It holds the smooth movements of computer, but the color and energy of the original 2-D style and I think it accomplishes much for the presentations this movie chose.-Is it weird? Yes! In a way though, it works, as a sort of catch all to help make things pop for all the styles integrated into this movie.The Music Songs Themselves... Mostly -Disney has proven they can make a big soundtrack with songs that top the charts in sales. Wish is another success, to some degree, in my book.-A style that feels one part rock opera and another part theatrical stage show, the movie has plenty of that composer feel to it and perhaps the more unique aspect of the film.-Ballads are powerful and expressive of their dreams, catchy and yet beautiful at the same time. While other songs hold more engagement with their visual numbers than the song alone.-The product is another collection of good numbers that may be more of the focus and goal than the story itself, but one in which avid Disney music lovers will fall and repeat for years to come.The Inspiration -Perhaps heavier than other films, Wish is packed with a lot of things to teach the lessons to motivate the audience to do great things.-The story itself is a bit preachy on this, trying to rub it in my face the importance of dreams and how to make them come true.-However, I appreciate the lesson, despite the presentation, and found that some of the other character arcs at least tried to tie to this and help push the story.-Add in the theatrical music and the animated drawing holding such powerful control of emotions, and I felt they accomplished the inspirational tone they were seeking.Star: -The ultimate merchandising in this movie, the cute little character is my favorite one of the film.-For not saying anything, the little guy has a lot of heart and character, his emoting by far some of the cutest aspects I've seen in a while and somehow the most diverse of the group.-He does so much with his little form, knitting, pranking, and somehow inspiring himself, he is an adorable movie wrapped in a small bundle, one to surely be exploited by the House of Mouse.The Easter Eggs -The movie is a big homage to the history of the studio, and well... it's probably the biggest focus of this movie, or at least bigger than they imagined.-Disney lovers are going to love finding all the references and inspiration in this movie, cameos galore sprinkled throughout for one to see, or in many cases listen, to what the writers wished to acknowledge.-Even the credits pay homage to the magic of the studios and what came before, a stunning finish with a song that helps add the ambience to fans like me who love the cartoons released over the 100 years.-And the End Credit scene holds a weighted tribute to the man who started it all, and while not necessarily the most mind blowing, it does soothe the heart and soul.DISLIKES:The Characters So Auxiliary -Outside of the goat and the star, most of the rest of the characters are rather plain, boring, and a dull reference and cultural card than anything else.-Most of the characters have a gimmick, but often used in the singing and comedic roles, with little else.-Given characters like Pumba, Mrs. Potts, and the Dwarves, you would think they can accomplish more than spitting out one-liners and a some very limited action moments that hold little weight.-Such a shame given the strong work that Disney was known for doing so long ago.Story -Outside of the inspiration, the story really doesn't hold any magic for me either.-A rather bland story of unoriginal tales, the unique factor is mediocre and just lacking the splendor the animation has.-I found the tale rushed, full of the bland challenges and weak development that really felt robbed like the wishes of the kingdom.-So much potential, but so lost to the music and hidden references that what we got was a quick, almost novella story that will be good for those with small attention spans.-Such a shame.Placement Of Music -Another gimmick feeling aspect, the music is again good, passionate, and magical, but the placement feels a very modern motif.-Previous films found the ideal place to put a song, or use it to convey thoughts, feelings, and storytelling that fans have dissected for years.-Wish felt like Frozen in a sense, lots of songs in one movie, weaker and filling space, seeming just odd to break out into song and dance. A little more tact might have made the song even more impressiveJokes Are Mediocre And Kiddish -What happened to the double entendre jokes, the clever puns and misunderstandings, or even the well-executed insults?-Wish has none of that for me. More so forced emotional delivery, kiddy emphasis on butts and spit, and sounding like a social media stars trying to quote a scene like the character and failing.-Only a few jokes escaped this style, but for the most part, I felt a lot of influencer vibes in the writing, which just isn't my style given the track record of this movie.Weaker Antagonist -This was sad given again the potential of Disney villains.-Maleficent, Scar, Gaston, and Rattigan, these and more had design, class, skills, and backing that made them so much fun to fight in the movies and games.-But Magnifico, outside of the design to look like his actor, is kind of lame. He's cunning sure, but that's it. No major groundbreaking moves, a rather tame use of his powers, and even a boring climactic fight did little to make him memorable.-It's not he's a bad character, just again, rushed and forgettable, lost in the flood of things crammed into about 80 minutes of actual movie.Overall Forgettable -The movie is unfortunately not the magnificent production this company promoted for the 100th anniversary.-It's a movie that feels too full of stuff, gimmicks, music, and references superseding the story and flow, to make a rather lacking film.-I see many of my friends enjoying this who are die hard Disney fans, young kids that are like them, or just all about singing songs and finding homage touching.-But for me, it needed more time, more planning, a better story and better use of these ideas to balance into the story and fully cast the Disney spell they can do.THE VERDICT: I'm sure you can guess, but Wish did not have the magic I had hoped it would have. While the animation and design are beautiful, and the voice acting helps bring some fun, the movie is really more about finding the hidden gems than actually telling that Disney feeling story. A rushed mess of mediocrity with weaker side characters, a boring antagonist and paying too many cards without planning, it feels like storytelling remains a tertiary objective for the House of Mouse.. At least the music, no matter how oddly placed, was able to maximize the inspiration and give you the hope that dreams can come true, just in time for the holiday season. Is this a go for the theater? In a way yes, the sound system does wonders for the music, and 3D could be fun as you ride the nostalgia with a star in the lead. But story and majestic wise... well... that might be best left for a home viewing.My scores are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 6.5-7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0."

The songs, jokes, and story all feel like they were written by ChatGPT. The lyrics don't make sense and seem like an AI prompt, the music is as bland as can be, and they plop characters in your face without any introduction and expect us to find them funny or endearing b/c they resemble other Disney characters. They try to do all these call backs to other Disney animated films since its \"Disney 100\" and it just ends up being strange and unsettling.The animation feels unfinished and awkward too. They linger on shots way longer than they need to, and the comedic timing is non existent. Disney feels like it's losing its magic."

Wish is a nice movie, but lacks what makes Disney animated movies so special.In Wish, young Asha wishes on a star, and gets more than she bargained for when a star comes down to help her in her quest to defeat the evil king Magnifico.The greatest advantage the movie has is its gorgeous animation, the brushstrokes painted beautifully on the screen. It is a wondrous blend of hand-drawn animation and 3d animation, a la Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. I hope we get many more films animated in this style, as it is very relaxing and nice to look at.If only the story matched the visuals... An overly simple story lacks anything of substance. And yes, I'm taking into account that this is a kids movie. I sympathized with the villain (who did not begin the movie evil) in the beginning of the film, only for him to suddenly turn evil out of no where. The film also suffers from a horrifying over dependence on magic. The songs are very good, but they all sound about the same, which isn't a problem in the movie, but I can't imagine the music in this movie selling many CDs. I do have to give the voice actors some credit though. They didn't do anything award worthy, but they did an excellent job.That being said, while I watched this movie, I enjoyed it. The only reason I went to see it was to take my nephews. Disney has a rich history of making the greatest animated classics of all time. They have a proven formula that works, and I hope they either return to it in the future, or try something else besides Wish. It's a decent movie, but there's nothing memorable about it, and I don't expect it will be long before it is forgotten."

This is only her first directorial work for Fawn Veerasunthorn, but she does have experience as a writer.Asha (voice of Ariana DeBosa) lives in the kingdom of Magnifico (voice of Chris Pine). As leader of his empire, he collects the dreams and wishes of the people and promises that he can make one of them come true.If Asha makes a wish when she sees a shooting star, this star will make her wish come true. With this star at her side, she tries to show the rest of the people that Magnifico is not an honest leader. His magical powers, which he uses to grant their wishes, are not the correct and only way to make wishes come true.With this film, Disney animation tries to celebrate its hundred years of existence and working on animated films. Despite this reason, unfortunately they have not created a special or unique animated film. This film quickly reminds you of many other films that Disney animation has made over the past hundred years. This film itself has little uniqueness. The film may be fun for younger audiences who are not yet familiar with Disney animated films, but older viewers who would go along with them may not enjoy this film as much.The animation style also tries to come across as if it comes from older animation, to celebrate the centenary. Apart from some creative animation, it unfortunately doesn't feel that special. The film can therefore seem somewhat standard or even boring. Most characters also come across as somewhat standard or even somewhat lifeless. Due to the large group of characters, most of them are given few opportunities to really stand out in the film. Asha's character is the most prominent because she is the main character of the film. Furthermore, Magnifico manages to steal the show as the more corrupt leader, because Chris Pine knows how to provide good voice acting. Alan Tudyk manages to provide some comic moments as a talking goat, but not enough to really make it something special. In other animation or other films he manages to provide more comic voice acting."

A lot of people have been criticizing this movie upon its release, saying it's overly generic and not as original as hoped for in celebrating 100 years of the Walt Disney Company. However, I think it's very good! Yes, there are some cookie-cutter and generic elements in the film, but it's not entirely a carbon copy of previous Disney films.The antagonist in this movie is revealed rather quickly; even from the very beginning, you know who the bad guy is and have a sense of how it will unfold. But I wouldn't say it's entirely unoriginal, as I've been hearing from many people. True, there are typical Disney songs with castles, kings, queens, and people making wishes upon a star, but I believe people have been overly critical due to recent disappointments with how the company has been managing things.Yes, I agree Disney hasn't been doing so well lately, but I don't think this movie is a bad addition to their tremendously successful catalog. I believe this movie truly holds the essence of emphasizing the importance of having wishes in your life but, more importantly, taking the necessary steps for your dreams to come true.There's been a lot of discussion about Disney's increased diversity in their cast nowadays, but I think it was a good fit for the new film. There were parts of this movie that honestly made me very emotional and pleased with its meaning and message because I've struggled in life to keep my dreams alive and well.Sure, there are talking animals and other Disney-esque elements thrown in, but the movie's meaning is what truly matters, and I think that's what people have been forgetting. I highly recommend people see this movie and not heed all the negativity. It's a good, clean, wholesome, and emotional family film that kids and everyone will enjoy, with meaningful and important messages about being honest with your dreams and never giving up on what you truly wish to become and more! Definitely check it out this holiday season!"

I wish they had just leaned in and milked this, instead of wasting screen time trying to show us how \"quirky\" the main character is supposed to be, as if it even mattered to the story. The storyline was overall kinda boring.Worldview A point in this movie's favor is that the sorcer overtly practicing witchcraft *is* the bad guy. However, the message of \"hope\" (and they did a whole song about this!) is that we are all (talking animals included) stardust, and that's why we look to the stars and our hearts to guide us. Fake deep new age nonsense.Animation I like that they *tried* to do something unique with the art style. The painted storybook texturing had the potential to be so beautiful, but they really didn't take it far enough, so a lot of the visuals came across as work in progress 3D animation.Music There were some nice musical moments, but overall very meh. I'm tired of the \"let's overexplain by clumsily cramming a bunch of words into a musical number and trying to make it sound like rap\" style that Lin Manuel Miranda likes. He didn't do the music, but it's clear who the song writers were trying to emulate in a couple of songs.After seeing this movie once, I don't feel like I need to see it again.

I will say the villain was not someone who was just misunderstood, he was truly taking a key piece of people for selfish gain and I hated him immediately, so they have that going for them."

Steven Spielberg added fairy dust to the song's mythology when he mentioned playing it over the final moments of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" For Disney, \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" is more than an anthem; it's a symbol of corporate magic and the company's values. Disney's new animated musical, \"Wish,\" is a folk tale about wishes and their connection to stars. The movie is a theme park-ready illustration of Disney's 100th anniversary, as it self-consciously packs 85 years of animated magic into a portable Disney fable. The movie is a blend of pop history and Easter eggs, making it a symbol of the company's focus on itself. The movie's success may be seen as a summation, pastiche, or a Disney fable that launches the next Disney century or is stuck in the last one. The movie's success may be seen as a symbol of Disney's commitment to its own brand and its ability to create a unique and memorable experience for audiences. \"Wish\" is a Disney animated film that is particularly appealing to young children, as it is set in the magical kingdom of Rosas, a tropical island. The residents of the island have a wish, which they give to King Magnifico, a devilishly handsome sorcerer who rules the island and their dreams. When a wish is given to Magnifico, it becomes free and unremembered. The story explores the concept of wishes and their consequences, with the protagonist living without their wish, leaving their soul untroubled. The film is visually pleasing and eminently watchable, with a plot that is both mildly touching and slightly strange. The film is a delightful slice of enchanted product with a slightly strange plot. \"Wish\" is a film that explores the concept of wishes, a deep part of one's identity. The story follows 17-year-old Asha, a spunky idealist who learns that a wish is a symbol of her identity. She applies to become the emperor's apprentice and meets Magnifico, a coiffed goateed smoothie. Asha questions the \"Your wish is mine until I decide to give it back to you\" concept, which reveals Magnifico's true nature. He is a kind leader until his authority is questioned, revealing his inner authoritarian nature. The film is a metaphor for the era of corporate entertainment, where individual dreams are replaced by collective fantasy. The film is a ruthless corporate overlord crossed with Maleficent, and the first Disney villain with serious hair product use. \"Wish\" is a Disney animated film that follows Asha, a young girl who makes a powerful wish that lights up the night sky and makes every citizen of Rosas glow with warmth. The wish is a glowing yellow star named Star, who has real magic. Asha uses her pet goat, Valentino, as her magic wand to take on Magnifico, a demonic figure with extraordinary power. The movie revolves around Asha and her angelic Star vs. Magnifico and his green phosphorescent demonic light, with the fate of the island residents and their wishes hanging in the balance. The film, co-written by Jennifer Lee and executive produced by Allison Moore, is a more muted palette of blue, green, gray, pink, and lavender, creating a pleasing storybook texture. Chris Pine's punchy performance as Magnifico turns him into a volubly self-satisfied narcissist-dictator is a standout performance. The film is a testament to the power of imagination and the power of imagination in bringing stories to life."

The writers couldn't even bother to make anything rhyme when shoehorning in their messaging. Nothing to do with the actors, color and what not (don't even start), and all to do with poor writing. It's like Disney put a gun to someone's head and demanded a movie be created based on the \"When you wish upon a star\" Disney theme. If we find out in the news later that that someone likely will be found dead on the floor and that the script was actually AI-generated, I wouldn't be surprised at all. Disney is reaching new lows. Truly.As mentioned by many others, the plot is crazy thin, there is no inner struggle, no mistakes made, no heroes journey, no villain having any sort of depth. On the last note, they actually teased the villain having some sort of back story and justification, but almost as soon as they introduced some of his history and fears, it was swept away reminiscent to a proverbial rug pull straight into shallow villainy. How awesome would it have been if we could be somewhat torn and sympathetic to the idea that some wishes actually can be damaging to others/dangerous, as the movie insinuates for maybe 5 seconds before casting aside? Wow this could have been a decent story, but Disney chose to walk on eggshells. They can't please anyone these days so we must all be triple wrapped in cellophane and styrofoam and forced to watch a \"safe\" movie. They truly lost their touch.

I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure."

This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."

I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

                    "content": "\"Oppenheimer\" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (\"The Dark Knight trilogy\", \"Inception\", \"Interstellar\", \"Dunkirk\"), based on the biography \"American Prometheus\" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the \"Manhattan Project\", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and \"Fat Man\" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the \"Atomic Age\". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as \"the father of the atomic bomb\", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic \"Oppenheimer\", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's \"Dunkirk\", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, \"Oppenheimer\" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10."

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!"

Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) \"twist\" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb."

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."

                    "content": "Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an \"attraction\" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually \"work\" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a \"genius.\" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take \"A Beautiful Mind\" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider \"Schindler's List\" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the \"Father of the A-Bomb\" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is \"star studded.\" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said \"Oh, look who that is,\" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10."

Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing."

The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10."

Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love."

The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!"

Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles."

The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia."

However, Oppenheimer is a film that I was eagerly awaiting because it is something very different from the rest of the director's filmography. Fortunately, the film is good. It is impossible to say that Oppenheimer is a poorly made product. But, it's definitely nothing more than a good movie. Technically speaking, it is very well produced. The sound work is magnificent, it manages to generate striking scenes, especially the explosion scene. Nolan managed to create a well-made biography, but it is clear the effort he makes to be an artist and in the end he fails. The third act is unbearable, it's stressful and it never seems to end. Oppenheimer's problems scream in your face that they are there, not allowing only the technical qualities to shine. Some scenes are rough precisely because of Nolan's enormous effort to be an artist and not just a good director. The film is good, nothing more than that. Certainly the most overrated film of the year and not as brilliant as many are saying."

It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him \"NO\". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, \"boring\" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained."

And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

                    "content": "Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth."

Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!"

Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece."

But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia."

It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again.

BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product."

Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out."

There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with.

For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?"

For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did."

The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it.

Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies."

I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction."

                    "content": "For a film like \"Barbie\" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.For a very basic overview, \"Barbie\" sees its titular character (played by Margot Robbie) living her stereotypically perfect life in Barbieland. Well, that is until she is plagued by those pesky intrusive thoughts of death, a flattening of her perfectly-heeled feet, and a trip to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to figure out what is going on. As it turns out, a rift has developed between Barbieland and the real world that only Stereotypical Barbie--accompanied by Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling)--can mend. But when Barbie & Ken have extremely different experiences in the real world, it leads to even more messiness between the worlds that precipitates further adventure/hijinks.In terms of plot, somehow Gerwig manages to write and direct her way into the perfect tone with \"Barbie\". A mere mention of the term \"patriarchy\" in today's polarized landscape will more often than not lead to a line in the sand that neither side will cross, yet Gerwig perfectly examines and satirizes the subject by making the proceedings just so darn fun. Much like, say, Jordan Peele before her did with horror flicks like \"Get Out\" or \"Us\", Gerwig uses a genre other than straight-up drama to get her satire and story themes across here. Sometimes, that proves to be the best \"delivery service\" and it is certainly true in this case.Of course, solid/unique actors are required to carry out this quirky film's shenanigans and softer moments, and \"Barbie\" comes up aces in that department too. Robbie is perfectly cast as the lead, with both her beauty and dramatic acting chops lending themselves to the film's own dual nature. But more often than not it is Gosling who steals the show every time he's on screen. To do what Gerwig wants to do with \"Barbie\", the Ken role has to be perfect--and is here in the versatile style of Gosling (one of Hollywood's most underappreciated acting talents). The rest of the cast is also filled with solid performances and wonderfully fun cameos.\"Barbie\" is just as much a visual treat as anything else--they didn't short the area of pink paint for no reason. DP Rodrigo Pieto creates a universe that is a sight to behold in every frame and then transitions some of those characters into a real-world environment with similar panache. All of this is of course given some drive by a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and even Gosling himself!Not only do I feel that \"Barbie\" eclipsed (even if narrowly in some cases) the bigger blockbusters like \"The Flash\", \"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 1\", & \"Oppenheimer\", but it subsequently vaulted Gerwig into the upper echelon of my must-see writers/directors (alongside Nolan, Villeneuve, Peele, etc.). After not knowing exactly what to expect from this film going in, I was utterly blown away by this experience."

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film."

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen). Equally strong is Fennell's screenplay which is hilarious, almost every scene has at least one memorable joke or biting line of dialogue."

                    "content": "I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of \"Another Country\" meets \"Brideshead Revisited\" as the story of \"Ollie\" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal \"Felix\" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of \"Felix\" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous \"Farleigh\" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and \"Ollie\" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success."

I don't think it is that deep, whether it was trying to dig into thorny Class stuff (it's a more Personal-Obsessive chronicle than that) when practically everyone is a vampire or not, save, tellingly, for who Oliver actually comes from. Frankly, knowing it was inspired by Talented Mr Ripley going in did no favors by comparison (with a bit of, aside from coincidentally \"You\" season 4, Teorema oddly enough), like at a festival with nothing to go on this might have got to me a little more.However, even with the obvious influences and one particularly glaring story problem - or just with logic involving a cell phone (you know, genius manipulator kid, you can block a phone number or just turn it off) - this is a glorious showcase for Barry Keoghan to (again!) be an intensely, leering, uncomfortable and yet always in his way natural creepy little confusingly-big shlonged weirdo; he and (second time this month post Priscilla an alluring) Elordi have excellent chemistry, and I can't stress enough that, with actors, in particular a scene-stealing Allison Oliver as the f'd-up sister, Fennell has as strong a grasp on her caat and like how far to let Pike and Grant go and when to reel them in (that scene with the checkbook is wonderful).If you want meaty acting, this definitely has that (a new category: Acting Over Substance?), and when it tries to be funny it largely is, and while it doesn't stand out as one of the best of the year it is an entertaining film moment to moment. If you were expecting another round of sociological buckshot in your brain, it doesn't have as much substantive things to say as Promising Young Woman did.Dare I say it now... whatever you got planned for Joker, Barry: bring it."

                    "content": "My Review - Saltburn My Rating 9/10 In selected Cinemas nowSaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress Emerald Fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance Promising Young Woman which starred her friend Carey Mulligan.Carey Mulligan only plays a cameo role in Saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of Poor Dear Pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.Carey Mulligan in an interview with Margo Robbie a co producer of Saltburn said that the role Emerald Fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. On reading the script Carey Mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear Pamela and Emerald agreed to her request .I'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of Lady Elspeth Catton played in the movie to perfection by Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike.This movie in fact has four Oscar nominees in the cast Richard E. Grant, Barry Keoghan, Carey Mulligan and Rosamund Pike.It's no wonder to me that Emerald Fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, two British Academy Film Awards, one Screen Actors Guild Award, and nominations for three Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards.One reviewer described this movie as a Promising Young Man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.My only regret with this movie is the fact that Emerald Fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of \"peeping in.\" The magnificent cinematography by Linus Sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.I call this movie an Art House black comedy thriller if I had to describe it in a few words I think I would say it's Brideshead Revisited with the style of Peter Greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like The Draughtsman's Contract , Drowning by Numbers and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover .This wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . It may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.Not everyone will share my view but I adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.I couldn't help thinking of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited while watching Saltburn so after seeing the movie I wasn't surprised to read that Emerald Fennell recommended Jacob Elordi the Brisbane born handsome actor read Brideshead Revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .In complete contrast Jacob will be playing Elvis Presley in the forthcoming movie Pricilla based on the early relationship of Pricilla Beaulieu and Elvis .In Saltburn Jacob Elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection Felix Catton the son and heir of Sir James Catton played with delicious detachment by Richard E Grant and Elspeth Catton perfectly cast with the glamorous Rosamund Pike .Rosamund Pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by Sophie Canale who was assistant costume designer on Bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper Oliver Quick also played to perfection by the Academy Award nominated Irish supporting actor Barry Keoghan in The Banshees of Inisherin Barry Keoghan.Barry Keoghan's character Oliver Quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at Oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .His character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his Summer of love into a quest of betrayal.The movie begins with Oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic Felix Catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts Oliver's nerdy dullness . Oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of Felix Catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.Similar to Brideshead Felix invites Oliver to spend the Summer at his family's ancestral home Saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch Elspeth .No spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.As mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled Radcliffe Square in Oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.The stately home that Emerald Fennell chose as Saltburn is Drayton House in Northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again I haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were Archie Madekwe as the young border at Saltburn Farleigh Start who sees through Oliver Quick and becomes an object of jealousy.Also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household Annabelle played by Sadie Soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing Butler played by Paul Rhys are wonderful.I'd love to spend a day in Emerald Fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in Killing Eve ,Promising Young Woman and now Saltburn I find fascinating."

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching."

There were Multiple Gasps and Audible \"oh god\" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience \"It was all too Wet\" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the \"Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar\" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, \"But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?\" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, \"Ok this is Ok, were building towards something\", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself \"Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels\"😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage \"of Events\" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say \"oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....\"Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it."

It's well-paced, beautifully presented in terms of production design and cinematography, Barry Keoghan in dazzling in the leading role, and he is well supported by, among others, Jacob Elordi. Archie Madekwe, Alison Oliver and Richard E. Grant. Rosamund Pike, putting her essential chilliness to good use, is surprisingly amusing. But there are few other surprises as we tread through the familiar world of the English upper class and its pampered progeny. Taking a sort of semi-critical stance, writer-director Emerald Fennell summons up the memory of a number of films that examine the British class system. Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Servant, The Go-Between, The Hireling...I even caught a whiff of the very obsure American film Black Flowers for the Bride. I can't work out whether or not Ms Fennell thought she was on to something new. If she did think so, she was clearly mistaken."

In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you. But if you prefer to be allowed to concentrate on the unfolding tale of immorality without the shock and awe, then TTMR is a far better movie."

Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the \"good\" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down."

                    "content": "Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend."

And that is the problem for me. The reviewing of previous events from a different perspective implies a cynicism and motive that does not fit the main character. So when it is presented, astute members of the audience are not going to view it as a twist but are more likely to think \"Hang on a minute, what about when....???\" So whose fault is that? Scriptwriter and director are the immediate culprits and here they are the one and only Emerald Fennell. Her Oscar for the \"Promising Young Woman\" may have been justified. I don't think she's going to get anything for this one unless the \"Razzies\" are stuck for choice.Just a note about Barry Keoghan and his performance . I wish I was a fly on the wall when his agent convinced him to a) be stark-naked and pretend to \"screw\" through the freshly-dug grave of a main character to highlight his obssession with said character and b) pretend to lick the porcelain floor of the bath where that obssession has just masturbated, (\"Saw\" franchise please take note, if you want to push the boundaries of revulsion, check if Fennell is doing anything).

This was a terrific film experience.I think the thing I love most about Phannell's work is the attention and care she gives to every character. There are no throwaway character's in these movies. Everyone has a purpose and every character is fascinating in their own way.When that's the case it can be hard to single out a particularly good character/performance, and really everyone here was worthy of mention, but in particular I have to bring up Rosamund Pike. She stole every scene she was in. Also Barry Keoghan is fast becoming the best actor working today. He is captivating to watch here.'Saltburn' was such a pleasant surprise. I loved every minute of it and would highly recommend it. Be warned though: this film is not afraid to go to some shocking places. 10/10."

More or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, British version of The Talented Mr Ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.Having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.Our protagonist Oliver (Barry Keoghan) is a scholarship boy at Oxford. Initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich Felix (Jacob Elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. There he is introduced to the bizarre world of the British aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.Having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. We are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between Oliver and Felix's sister Venetia (Alison Oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.As a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.There are strong performances throughout the film - Rosamund Pike, as Felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. Jacob Elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a British aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. Richard E. Grant, as Felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.And there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. Pamela (Carey Mulligan) is a guest at Saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. Farleigh (Archie Madekwe) is Oliver's rival for Felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. This is particularly disappointing as Archie Madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.The final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. At 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and I confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

                    "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN (2020). She's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. We are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of Barry Keoghan.Oliver Quick (Keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the Class of 2006 at Oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. He becomes transfixed on the BMOC, Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi, fresh off his turn as Elvis in PRISCILLA). Felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. Life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. He's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day Oliver helps him out of a jam. This leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. The first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to Felix inviting Oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... Saltburn.Saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. Felix's eccentric family includes Farleigh (Archie Madekwe, GRAN TURISMO), an adopted \"cousin\" fellow Oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; Venetia (Alison Oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; Poor Dear Pamela (Carey Mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; Sir James Catton (Richard E Grant), the childlike father; and Espeth Catton (Rosamund Pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. It's a motley crew that puts 'The Royal Tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.As the summer progresses, we see Oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. His non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. As viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with Oliver, yet director Fennell and Keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. Those hopes are dashed once we see Keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and Fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.The third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with Fennell and Oscar winning cinematographer Linus Sandgren (LA LA LAND) creating an Old World style within a contemporary world. The film is perfectly cast with Elordi quite magnetic as Felix, the not-so-obscure object of Oliver's desire. Madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting Farleigh, and Grant and Pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. Alison Oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while Keoghan nails the creepy Oliver (in line with his roles in THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER, and THE BATMAN. He has become the go-to psychopath. He even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY (1999) as its most obvious comparison. Ms. Fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.Opening in theaters on November 22, 2023."

It then rushes through the 3rd act where the body count stacks up so quickly it doesn't have time to be impactful. The grave scene was utterly ridiculous, I felt embarrassed for everyone involved in the making of that scene, but yeah somehow it got made.Respect to the Music Supervisor though, some great choices including Bloc Party & Tomcraft.

The idea of being popular runs a little too dark when a chance meeting between Felix (a rich Gatsby-esque character played by Jacob Elordi) and Oliver (a socially awkward, possibly autistic, bright literary genius) at Oxford.There are a few things that will rub you the wrong way. Yes, it's suppose to be a dark comedy. I think Rosamund Pike, who plays Felix's mother is the only one who understands that the key to dark comedy is to be a bit over the top. Richard E. Grant plays the Dad who, unfortunately doesn't get the big eyed meltdown until the end. The other things you will either love or hate.... There is no reason for ANYONE to like Oliver. Ever. Barry Keoghan plays him great, but it isn't like he flips a switch and becomes charismatic. In fact, he just becomes a weirdo saying charismatic things. Perhaps that's the intention. The family is so devoid of emotion that any genuine sign of it gains acceptance. Again, I never felt that.There is absolutely NO reason for Oliver to know that Felix would be so generous as to ingratiate him into his family by a flat tire ruse. The conceit of this entire film relies on the idea that Oliver is a grifter preying on this family and that someone would be kind enough to take him in. He sees what he wants, then has the shameless nature of approaching each one to gain favor. Honestly, one of the worse flip of the switch is when Oliver observes the sister of the household and seduces her (after a few words--saying she's a nympho doesn't make it so).Any way, Rosamund Pike is the only good thing about this flick. Jacob Elordi is also really good at embodying the rich snob with a heart. The rest is a bit mediocre.

All of the production designs are gorgeous throughout, especially with the costumes and structures as it was very colorful with the 1:33:1 aspect ratio feeling purposeful. All of the performances are pretty great, especially Barry Keoghan as Keoghan continues to impress me with his performing abilities since Dunkirk. Alongside with the rest of the cast members as Rosamund Pike, Jacob Elordi, Richard E. Grant and so forth are really good as well and their performances were strong as well. The soundtrack is also really catchy.On the narrative, I did find the narrative's concept to be interesting as the concept explores interesting themes of wealth, sexuality, and class about the characters and settings that does get pretty unhinged and insane. Unfortunately, despite liking some of the writing, the narrative does get uneven since some of the writing aspects were predictable and certain moments feeling way too similar to \"Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Talented Mr. Ripley or The Servant\". Especially the third act and twist which while I am not sure it was intentional, the third act pretty much falls apart and I found the twist to not be really shocking and it being predictable. For the characters, while I understand the purposes for the characters' personalities and decisions, I found the characters to be a mix of some interesting and uninteresting as the uninteresting ones felt annoying. Including the editing as the editing is surprisingly, pretty rough.The dialogue is solid with some a bit silly and the color presentation is good. There are uses of dark humor, satire and quite a lot of horny moments throughout and while some of the satire and humor worked, not all worked as some of the dark humor, satire and horniest comes off a bit full of itself.I wanted to really love this movie because the style, writing and genre is something I like. I really love the concept, direction, camerawork, and performances but I was left wanting more than since the movie feels slightly sloppy and kind of full of itself.

It is a very British psychological thriller with plenty of charm, youthful energy, and originality. The early 2000s aesthetic is lush and on point. I truly believe that this film utilizes the so-called 'eat the rich' narrative perfectly, and is easily the best film of that genre. The film is kind of a cross between Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" and Mike White's \"The White Lotus\". I need the film's soundtrack like yesterday.

Perhaps I am over-analysing, but it seems strange that while time is taken to provide an explanation why Adam speaks with an Irish accent when both his parents are English, other questions remain unanswered.The acting is good; Scott is nicely subtle and Jamie Bell, as his father, is noteable for his believable, naturalistic performance as a suburban dad. I do not understand why Mescal puts on an English accent; if the character had to be English, why did the producers not hire an English actor? And if Mescal specifically was required, why not let him play it Irish? Such is his pulling power it would hardly have adversely affected the viewing figures. It must also be hoped the shaggy moustache Mescal sports in this never makes a reappearance! (Ditto that sported by Bell.)An odd film in many ways; it is a ghost story with a gay romance thrown in. Either storyline would have made a film by itself, but neither detracts from the other one. An enjoyable, tear-jerker film."

It is a raw watch, which touches on the themes of loss, pain, and love.The 2024 awards season should look favourably on Andrew Scott's performance in this film. His portrayal of this mans intriguing, yet sensitive approach of coming to terms with such tragic events in his life could not have been played better by any other actor. An enormous amount of credit must to go Andrew Haigh's directing and writing, who produced a flawless ensemble to play off of a script where every scene and word was situated perfectly."

There was a standing ovation with people cheering and whistling through their tears. What an experience.All of Us Strangers is a tale of Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD). It shows how multiple traumas compound inside us (or \"get tangled up inside your chest\" as Andrew Scott's character says). This causes people to live in 'survival mode,' self-medicate, and engage in self-protective behaviours. These three coping mechanisms are quick and easy ways to ruin your own life. But what other option do traumatised people have? All of Us Strangers attempts to answer that question.Andrew Scott is a popular and likeable actor, but this film is an opportunity to see him at the top of his craft. His performance is very restrained and his micro-expressions are heartbreaking.Paul Mescal... has ruined another pop song from the 1980s!"

Foy, Bell, Scott and Mescal did everything and superbly. All will have a big moment in this film but all were given a time to shine. Mescal and Scott especially. They highlight well the feeling of urban loneliness and has great chemistry something missing with almost every modern pairing. The ending is just masterclass acting. You should be excited seeing that.Which points to the screenplay. I do think that the biggest strength of this film is that it is pointed film. The addition of the supernatural elements help meld the judgmental past to a much more open future. And see two of this thinking contrast each other. Its a lovely touch since the Scott's character is all alone and seemingly wanting of a familiar touch. AND happily, it also stuck its ending. Probably one of the better film ending this year.I do put a big minus for two things. I do think the pacing of the first twenty minutes of the film does feel too slow.

The best terms to label this movie are not easy to find, thereby not implying it is a mixed bag, the latter usually used in the negative sense, certainly not my intention. Being \"officially\" labeled Drama and Fantasy, I find it has also a flavor of Romance, SciFi and Horror, at least a mixture of all of the above, with the latter three a bit on the back seat. Fact is that one continuously wonders where the story is heading, only to be surprised by the next unexpected plot twist.Given the large apartment block, an upwards looking image of it opens (and ends) the movie, one tends to think it is important. Nearly empty, dark windows all over, only two inhabitants on separate floors, a cliche décor for a Horror. One would assume it to be the center piece of the story, an initial feeling that proved to be completely wrong. It is only important for the start, a vehicle to let the two inhabitants meet. It is started by Harry on the lookout for someone to share a drink, thus ringing the door of his only neighbor Adam. Rather than inviting him in, the logical thing to do when you are lonely too, Adam sends him away as Harry appears a bit drunk. However, that is not the end of their relationship.Next, I think I missed a clue. We see Adam travelling to the house where he grew up. I missed the reason why he did that. He rang the bell, and he meets his parents as they were on the age they died, some 30 years ago. They recognize him and welcome him home as if nothing happened. None of this is a spoiler (yet). This information is included in all descriptions of this movie. But it is also the stopping point. No further details are to be given away after this, to enhance the surprise. I announce even multiple surprises underway.In multiple visits, inventive dialogs between Adam and his parents are to follow. The best example is about him being openly gay (\"you mean gay as in homosexual?\", asks his mother, who is apparently behind with modern terminology). As usual, parents try to find an explanation why their son is not \"normal\", and they even speculate whether they felt it already when he was young.The finale took a turn that I found difficult to follow. Maybe you stand a better chance to tie is all together. The overall story and execution warrant a score 8/10, but I subtracted a point for the finale I did not understand."

My parents reconciled to the past through songs. With the music and everything in the past, my eyes are still wet, and the final anti-transferor is caught off guard. We are always lonely.

                    "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. So many people allow unresolved issues from their past to weigh down or complicate their efforts to live for today. Writer-director Andrew Haigh has loosely adapted the 1987 novel \"Strangers\" by Taichi Yamada most notably by a shifting of locale and gender. It features the powerful literary trio of loss, loneliness, and love, none of which come easy for Adam, played beautifully here by Andrew Scott.Adam is a reserved London-based writer in his 40's who recognizes that he has failed to fully repress one particular fact of his childhood. Since his parents died in a car crash thirty years ago when he was twelve, he never had the opportunity to come out to them as gay. Now, he is often burdened by being the kid/grown-up whose parents never go to know the real Adam.An unusual meet-cute in the mostly vacant apartment tower they both reside in, has neighbor Harry (a terrific Paul Mescal) knocking on Adam's door carrying a bottle of spirits. Adam turns him away, but there's clearly an attraction. The progression after this night leads Adam down a tricky road. His writing forces him to face the lingering complexity with his parents, and this occurs in a few excellent sequences with Adam re-visiting his childhood home (actually director Haigh's childhood home) and finding his parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy) living there, unaged since he last saw them. Adam comes out separately to each, resulting in quite different reactions. Mom's words, \"It's a sad life, isn't it?\" cut like a knife while also emphasizing the social changes over the past 30 years. After claiming he would have been one of those schoolyard bullies, dad confesses he's sorry for not coming to Adam's room when he was crying.These interactions with the past allow Adam to begin to move forward, and that includes Harry, who has his own issues with the past. Together, the two are natural, and their debate of queer versus gay is beautifully executed. We understand how Adam dealing with his grief and guilt opens him up to a hopeful future of love, as leaving the past behind delivers the courage necessary to open up. Taichi Yamada recently passed away (November 2023), and it's likely he would have approved of Haigh's film. Andrew Haigh is proving to be quite an artist with this latest on the heels of his LEAN ON PETE (2017), 45 YEARS (2015), and a couple episodes of \"The OA\". This film is somber and slow moving, but the direction is excellent and the two leads Scott and Mescal (rumored to be the next James Bond) make this work.Opening in theaters on December 22, 2023."

The problem is, however, that his imagery is not strong enough to hold my attention for as long as the film demanded, and the film's plot was also paper thin.A lot of scenes come off as awkward, and unnatural because the characters should be talking, but for some inexplicable reason are not. I was starting to wonder if I had missed a scene where everybody gets shot in the neck, and not just the main character? It was ridiculous! Even when the wife is grieving with him and he goes all insane, throwing things and raging, she just stares at him and says nothing. Same with Kid Cudi's character. A lot of his screentime is just him staring at some photos or into a room without saying anything. Made the film almost unbearable to watch.The plot itself was ripped right out of Death Sentence, which was also a ripoff of Death Wish. I'm thinking Hollywood needs either better ideas, or better filmmakers. I don't mind a reused idea, but reuse it with purpose, to expand or better the previous product. Neither happened here.I also want to touch on how cheap the film looked. I'm not sure what the budget was, but surely they could have done better than this. The vast majority of the film is shot frenetically, so it's hard to see the action most of the time. It's also shot in some pretty low light, also making it difficult to see anything. The cinematography is what should draw people into this movie, considering that it probably didn't even have a script, and they couldn't even pull that off.Overall, this film is a mess and a shame. Such a simple premise and you make one of the most boring and irritating action films I think I've ever seen.

Instead, we are faced with an ever-increasing level of horror, rage, and madness. Woo has been known to give violence an almost ballet type of choreography (Bullet time slow motion) but that is not what we are seeing here. With the rage of the main character, we are faced with depression, rage, and madness which causes an ever-increasing degree of violence that continues to the very end of the film. This film should have ratings of extreme violence attached. While I watched the entire film I was left with a deep feeling of disatisfaction when it was over.

While Kinnaman's character is literally silenced due to his being shot in the throat renders him mute and his impressive implosive performance can't make up for the pedestrian trope-laden story (i.e. The police not doing their job).

He makes little effort in trying interesting ways to propel the story within the confines he set up.

At 77 years old, he hasn't lost touch with the genre and delivers his style of operatic kinetic action sequences that don't displease. However, the action sequences and Joel Kinnaman's performance is the only thing good about the movie. Predictable is one thing, but the movie is the same action movie we have seen before with a revenge aspect.Set at Christmas time, Brian (Joel Kinnaman,) and his wife Saya (Catalina Sandino Moreno,) lose their only son to a stray bullet after two rival gangs shoot from cars at each other in their neighbourhood. Brian chases them down, and he's shot in the throat. The title, \"Silent Night,\" Is because it's a silent movie with almost no dialogue, and that is where the film's biggest problems lie. Brian not speaking adds something different to the film as he uses facial expressions to convey feelings or the situations he finds himself in.Brian chases the gang members down and he is shot in the throat by Playa (Harold Torres,) a typical gang member with tattoos on his face. He shoots Brian, who recovers in the hospital, losing his ability to speak and discovering that his son has died. When he returns home, he hits the bottle and becomes engrained with revenge. He marks on the calendar the day he is going after the gang members while his wife watches him drink like a fish and lose himself, not knowing what to do or how to help him.Nobody speaks a word in the film. The only dialogue is from radio transmissions from Police chatter and that's it. Characters get punched, struck by a car or they scream when they are shot. There are some scenes of text between Brian and his wife but this doesn't further the plot because we know what kind of movie this is. A means to an end. There is an emotional story here but everyone is useless along with the gang who are going to get violently blown away by running right into the bullets.Brian is so filled with revenge. Joel Kinneman plays this well. Method acting in the mirror trying to scream, and you see the rage. He armours his car, learns to use a knife and becomes efficient at using handguns. He plans a date on the calendar when he is going after them. In the meantime, he becomes cold towards his wife, conducts surveillance on the gang leader responsible and hands the case to a cop, Detective Vassal (Kid Cudi) who is useless because his silence takes away from the idea that Brian was shot in the throat and can't talk but this guy can talk. How his character unfolds is one of the dumbest aspects of the movie.In the second act of the movie, I figured out the ending, and I was correct. You know that moment where it just clicks because you have seen it before, and where can the story go after this? There is no second story for a character like this.Brian sinks deeper into mania until one year passes, and he loads up every gun he has and puts on a bulletproof vest. His plan is to kill them all and he executes it almost flawlessly. But when you see Playa and his dumb girlfriend, he keeps on heroin, dancing, it just drags because it's all sound and noise. Saya sees she can't help anymore and the tight close-ups of her tears there make you feel for their situation. It is heartbreaking to see but when Brian is about to become a one-man army, how are we supposed to feel when he is simply another vigilante?First, he uses a car to spin around the thugs and shoots them all, al la \"John Wick,\" and then he appears on a motorcycle and shoots his way inside. Playa sends more of his goons after him and the idea of the grieving father is here, but because we don't hear anything from anyone, it's hard to convince feelings towards the characters, especially the dumb cop. He blasts his way through Playa's Batman-like skyscraper leading to the staircase sequence and eventually to Playa.\"Silent Night\" has great action sequences, but we have seen this before. Joel Kinneman is great, and the story is tragic and violent, but at the heart of it is vengeance which is used as an excuse for bullets to fly and cars to crash in glorious fashion. There is an emotional message about fatherhood here, and when tragedy strikes, what do you do? \"Death Sentence\" by Kevin Bacon conveyed this message much better, and I thought a lot about it while watching this movie because it's very similar right down to the story, but that was a better movie.5/10."

That is what he is known for and he has stuck to that throughout most of his career in the business. Face/Off and Hard Boiled are awesome action films, so if I ever get the chance, I'll check out his latest. Well, Silent Night is his latest American effort and I must say, he hasn't lost his touch with action. With that said though, it was just okay overall. It has a lot of promise and some great ideas, but something bogged it down for me. Here are my thoughts.After a gang accidentally kills the son of a couple just trying to live a happy life, the husband, Godlock (Joel Kinnaman) decides to go after them. He ends up shot in the neck, preventing him from ever speaking a word again. His mission then becomes to train his body to take on this gang and kill them all. The unique aspect of this film is the fact that it is told entirely without dialogue. Not a single one of the characters speaks one word. I enjoyed that aspect, but I do wish it was utilized more than just having nobody speak. Nothing was interesting past the point of just not having him talk. It was clear that Woo just wanted to focus on the action and that was worth the price of admission.There wasn't a lot of originality in terms of the action set pieces, but it was all very well-choreographed. From a standout fight that takes place in a house, to a great stairwell scene, the action held my attention. With that said, the good aspects of this film are bogged down by the sappy nature of the backstory. The way his past with his child is presented is kind of cheesy at first and there is a specific moment towards the end of the film that almost made me chuckle when it was clear the film was trying to be very emotional. The schmaltz of it all overtook the film and ruined a few moments.Joel Kinnaman is an actor I like very much and his performance here is quite solid, but I'm not sure he was given enough to do, other than either be incredibly angry or sad. It's a very thin story and screenplay and the final product shows that. Still, if you enjoy action, there is enough here to satisfy viewers. The absent dialogue is a great idea, but this type of film needed some in my opinion. Silent Night is a little too cheesy at times, but I still think it's worth a watch if you are already interested. Now playing in theatres, there are worse options to watch than this one."

Almost no one speaks a word of dialogue through the entire film. Does it work? NOPE. NOT AT ALL. Because film makers believe the audience is incredibly stupid, now more than ever. And without character motivations carefully explained through words all that is left to do is make every single action that appears on screen cartoonish beyond belief. I kid you not, what appears on screen in this film also works as a perfect parody of modern action movies. This film can be hilarious if you choose to view it from that perspective. I laughed out loud a lot.I am giving it 3 stars because it is filmed competently. Visually appealing, well edited, well choreographed action. But without believable situations and characters to care about it all falls flat.And, for the love of all things good, WIND UP MUSIC BOXES MUST BE BANNED FROM CINEMA FROM THIS POINT FORWARD."

                    "content": "John Woo's Violent, Silent Night is a Bold Experiment That Works. While John Woo's new film, which hits theaters December 1st, has many elements that embody the reasons international action film fans idolize him, it has one character trait that is distinct from other Woo films. In fact, it is unique from all modern, full length movies. That feature is that the film has no dialogue. When I use the phrase \"no dialogue\" it is not hyperbolic to mean limited dialogue. There is, literally, no dialogue, at all.While this bold cinematic experiment could have been disastrous, it was not. In fact, it is critical to the film's appeal. This unique perspective, actually, elevates this film to a higher art form, without ever losing the raw grit and violent, action thrills that are at its core. The film's success lies in the fact that it is so well made, and the acting is so thoughtfully constructed, that the audience never longs for what does not even seem to be missing-spoken words. After viewing this one I had to remind myself that there was no dialogue. That is a tribute to the solid storytelling throughout Silent Night.Joel Kinnaman stars in, and does much of the heavy lifting, in this one. Kinnaman, a relative unknown to American movie audiences, is the fulcrum around which the entire weight of the film rests. His stellar ability to solidly convey to the audience his angst and despair over the murder of his son, and his laser pointed focus in avenging his death without words is what propels the film from an ordinary action film to an extraordinary one. This is a solid performance that happens to be in an action film, and not in spite of it.Catalina Sandino Moreno does an equally powerful job balancing the emotions of being the mother of a murdered son, who can not seem to break through the forcefield which is surrounding her husband's emotional descent. Moreno is the heart of the film, for sure.John Woo is known for his masterful Direction of action sequences. His, The Killer (1989), is considered one of the best action films of the 20th Century. This film builds on his distinguished body of work with jaw dropping vehicular chase scenes, chaotic shootouts, and visceral hand to hand exchanges. These are filmed with magnetic precision, and the elimination of shaky-cam effects, leading to a riveting result.While the film has the traditional martial arts theme of revenge, Kinnaman's lack of the conventional training of John Wick, Taken's Bryan Miller, and Nobody's Hutch Mansell is an asset to the film. His attempt to elevate his physical body and fighting skills to be able to obliterate his enemies is part of the film's brutal realism. This one is extremely violent, but it is all part of the roller coaster ride. He is a man driven by a singular cause, and we feel his pain.The entire supporting cast here does an admirable job of telling their part of the story. They are very good. The villains are, certainly, a little over the top here, but that makes their demise so much more satisfying.Marco Beltrani's musical score is as much a character in the film as any member of the cast. Music in movies is an important element of the storytelling; however, not all scores have the same level of importance. Perhaps, because of the lack of dialogue here, the score is vital and it does its job effectively.The real question on my mind as I left the NYC screening was, \"Like Die Hard, will people be debating whether Silent Night is, actually, a Christmas movie for years to come.\" While I am not sure of the answer to that question, I do know that John Woo's, Silent Night, is a winner. This Lionsgate release is greater than the sum of its parts. It is one of the best action films of the year, and I highly recommend it."

While I understand it's the crux of the motivation, we get 30 minutes of his suffering before he decides to do a thing. Feels emotionally manipulative, wringing every last drop of milk from the tragedy to the point where it can't be called a fun action film in the least. The entire film is dialogue free, which works for him since he loses his voice, but becomes a big, dumb gimmick as every character in the film is given an excuse not to speak. One is gagged, one cries and texts the entire film, one is simply quiet and stoic and the rest grunt and groan to fill the gaping void. So finally, after a long cliched montage of him body building and gun training (and why he needs to be extra ripped I don't understand, but I'll buy it). He has a year to plan the perfect revenge and what does he do? Drives up, makes a lot of noise, makes every mistake imaginable & is constantly getting beat up and luck saves him every single time. Bad guys aim for his bullet proof vest over and over again, they give him long cool looks instead of just shooting him as he loudly makes himself an eye sore in every situation, never using even the smallest amount of stealth. He decides not to shoot a woman who just unambiguously just shot at him to kill him, which obviously doesn't go well for him. He tells the bad guys he's coming for him and is surprised that they best him. The lead bad guy decides to dance with his girl for like 10 minutes in slow motion as he is killing all his guys in what is possibly the most over decorated art direction ever in a movie... his lair looks like a groovy Los Angeles art installation or something meow wolf would dream up, hardly a gang member's decorating style. He sees his son in things and plays with his toys over and over stopping the action in its tracks. And finally, why are all the gang members cliches from 1990's movies? Why are they squatting and squaring off in abandoned ruins of buildings? Don't they have anywhere better to be? This movie was a boring, ridiculous, mess. John Woo tried his best to make it interesting visually, but the hyper style that worked in films like Face/Off never stops and makes it feel even more dramatically over the top."

I went into the film blind, and oddly enough I had watched John Woo's magnum opus, Hard Boiled, for the millionth time about a week ago and while thematically, it is significantly different, I still liked it. I grew up as a child watching the relentless Hong Kong classics on VHS in the 90's, and while some may soon be saying it didn't reach those heights. I don't think it was supposed to it.This was a quite interesting experiment of combining character study and an explosive Gun-Fu action flick. I must say, it worked much better than I anticipated it would. This was a wholly unique movie in a sea of the same old boring action movies (insert 500 movies in the last 5 years). In fact, the trailers before the film were literally the stale Jason Statham, solo action hero BS that this film amazing breaks free from to provide a fun and special experience. The action was not quite Hard Boiled extremes, but it was well choreographed. The acting was good enough to convey a story with no words. Thumbs up, fun movie for a change, the movie landscape seems to be changing.People should also remember how frequently John Woo has commented on many of things I have a feeling younger folks, or folks new to his work, will soon complain about. He acknowledges that nobody reloads their weapons because it \"interrupts the flow of the action\", the enemy couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat (people shooting 2 feet away from each other and hitting nothing). There needs to be a suspension of disbelief for Woo films, and there have been for decades, just relax, and enjoy the violence.While I am getting sick of CGI car accidents (I saw that in another different movie very recently but can't remember), and the digital blood and wish there would be a return to the classic use of practical effects. I miss the 90's and all its paper/debris flying, squib orgies, and people actually hitting each other. But this film does have the classic practical effects to a large degree and while the digital effects would be my only complaint. I REALLY liked this and would recommend."

Truly silent, minus a few bits of radio chatter and music with action sound effects. This is what sets it apart from other revenge flicks, though, and part of the reason why it is fresh, but also a little problematic. It has to get to the action as quickly as it can, but needs to fill the run time, so has a shaky first half, albeit a very rewarding second half.Many movies, especially from the past 10 years, start twenty minutes later than movies used to begin. Character building is lost because we are thrown into the action. For this to truly work, on a quick popcorn movie, the film would have to be just over an hour. Since we are over that theoretical minimum of 90 minutes, there's a chunk of slow-moving scenes at the start. We get hit over the head with the reasoning behind the vengeance, and it's done in a slow, no dialogue way. Once you get past this, then you can settle in for some very good action scenes! Luckily these action scenes are rewarding enough to deal with a frustratingly unlikeable hero and a shallow supporting cast.I could definitely see rewatching this, but only for the practical action that is very well directed. Some people may not get far enough into the movie appreciate some John Woo thrills, but if you give it 30 minutes (or chapter skips), then it's very worth your time."

I genuinely felt like this had so much potential and I was so excited to see it realized. I kept imagine how intense sequences of pure action must be without any interruption of dialogue. I kept imagining the unique focus on the visuals and sounds to replace the work of the dialogue. Mr. Robot pulled off a thrilling episode with no dialogue, so surely this movie could've too. Truly there was so much that could've been done and this would've been a classic. Unfortunately that trailer literally showed the best moments, and not much was done with the concept.All they really had to do was follow the John Wick blueprint but focus more on the visual storytelling and give it a unique angle with the mute protagonist on top of the lack of dialogue that could've made this movie so much more tense. Unfortunately, the lack of dialogue detracts from the characterization and feels forced in many scenes. I feel like there could've been a lot more done with the protagonist who's very well performed, but not well written. I question his willingness to go on shooting sprees when his son was killed by a stray bullet. There is nothing really done with the protagonist suddenly becoming mute, and the drama with his wife has no real development. The mandatory set up for the emotional beats to hit are executed in such a boring and cliche way and takes up what feels like half the film. Every scene with the son felt so repetitive, and like it was begging you to care with the music, but I really didn't. It almost became cheesy, especially at the end. There's this cop character that's just... there, I guess. There's no personality given to the villains except it keeps cutting to the main villain drugging and shagging this random girl...When we finally get to the action John Woo does deliver, but it's not his best work, and doesn't redeem such a thin story. There's moments of Woo's brilliance shining through what are mostly just pretty good action sequences by today's standards. A lot of the car scenes weren't the best either. The action has its moments and the visuals are often cool, but even then there are some odd directorial choices like overuse of slow-mo and some odd editing choices. I always just felt like there's this great action scene coming, and some parts were, but other parts were off. What's worse is that much of the action feels completely unbelievable and just dumb with the protagonist, of course, getting along through luck and pure incompetence from the villains. The last 2 confrontations in this movie are what really tanked it for me to call it bad. It's just plain ridiculous and unsatisfying how they unfold. Genuinely feels like some AI choreography, unreal, and it's so stupid character wise.With all this being said I still mostly enjoyed the movie thanks to some good action and visuals, but I felt like it was more due to the goodwill I have for John Woo, like I owe him for his older awesome films. This was overall a disappointing film and such a waste of the concept. I hope someone else tries something like this again and does better. I don't want to be too hard on Mr. Woo though. Please John Woo, you are better than this, and we still love you!(4/10)"

I found myself laughing out loud at a few points because of the way he chose to execute something without saying anything, it felt very silly during very serious moments. If you're going to go silent, you have to at least give the audience something more clever than a predictable action movie.

The father goes after the criminals, but is also shot and his vocal cords are activated.He can no longer talk, but he wants revenge. So he begins to train himself to take impossible Christmas revenge on the gang members who took his son and his voice away.With Silent Night, John Woo makes a directorial comeback after 20 years, because he has no longer controlled American action films since his 2003 film Paycheck. John Woo has often made his private action films unique in special ways. He now tries to do the same again by using almost no real dialogue in this film, apart from some background dialogue from music and news radio.Joel Kinnaman has to work more with facial expressions and body postures to act. He does this well, but if there had been a little more dialogue at the beginning of the film, the story could have been a bit clearer. Due to the lack of speech, the film can sometimes remain unclear. Catalina Sandino Moreno plays his wife and mother of the child who died. She knows how to portray a good, supporting role. Unfortunately, she fades into the background halfway through the film, during the father's revenge campaign. Kid Cudi plays a cop in the film who tries to investigate the attack on the father and son, but he still comes across as more in another film. If they had left his character out of the movie, the movie could have been a bit shorter and clearer.The story remains a standard revenge action film, in which characters, for personal reasons, want to take revenge on people who have harmed or taken something away from them. This film is somewhat reminiscent of John Wick's Deadpool, only with less humor or similar action.There are entertaining action scenes in this film, but unfortunately they are not that special and not at all for a Jon Woo action comeback. The action scenes do have some creative moments with good visual effects. Unfortunately, not all of the effects even look significant. Some explosions seem less realistic.

Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through \"The Marvels\", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be \"apathetic\", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original \"Captain Marvel\" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original \"Captain Marvel\" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series \"Ms. Marvel\", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as \"The Marvels\" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."

There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."

Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene.

However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent.

Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought \"Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?\" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."

It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."

It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."

Feige pulled off \"wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring\" trick again. And it wasn't a \"wow\" for me at least.

This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."

Zoom out on the early Avengers movies and you can see all that displayed because of Thanos. Some MCU movies do that better than others, and even a few DC movies nick it as well.

With their powers interlinked, forcing them to keep switching into each other, how the trio manage to stop Dar-Benn forms rest of the story.The existing problem of MCU continues with The Marvels as well where we once again get a pointless addition to the franchise, whose sole purpose is to reveal that post credit scene. With a weak villain and an extremely powerful lead i.e. Captain Marvel who gets to team up with two others, no matter how much the stakes are raised, it never feels like a challenge to the mighty superhero. Instead the focus is on the teen humor.The best thing about The Marvels is it's short runtime. The humor not always work as intended though some of the jokes did work to an extent. The emotions too were on the surface level only. The reunion honestly should've been dealt better. Resorting to solving the high stakes problem in a simpler way or even randomly figuring out the solution, failed to register. On paper, it wasn't a terrible idea but when you have Captain Marvel, it is mandatory to give her a strong villain and a better story she deserves. Otherwise, there is only so much Kamala Khan can do with her jokes."

Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the \"Paul is dead\" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, \"The Marvels\" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like \"Wakanda Forever\" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."

She tries on her acting and drama and humour pants and found they didn't fit, so she just fumbles around and does a poor job.Rambo was introduced as an apologist for slavery and torture, got some kind of turning intangible thing going on which she got by walking for some reason, in a D+ show so she's probably new to most people.The bad guy was pathetic, the plan she sort of vaguely has, something to do with stealing an atmosphere for some reason to do something for some reason that wasn't made clear, to finish the plan of somebody but she doesn't say who that was, or what their plan was, and she is not in any way threatening. Her acting sucked also.The whole premise was idiotic. It could have been interesting if they had some kind of plan or plot before filming started instead of trying to fix it in post production, so what we got was sometimes three characters (one who fires light stuff, one who makes glowing purple stuff, and one who can apparently see light so she claimed in the script that her power is to not be blind) who sometimes switch places when they use their powers, but sometimes they don't.It's extremely inconsistent and only happens when convenient for the 'plot' or when some script writer with no sense of humour thinks it would be funny.Then lasers and flying around and fight scenes and some very sketchy CGI.And that's it. I tuned out for most of it, got bored after a while and so I can't remember most of what happened so I'll find out from a future Pitch Meeting who will do a much better job explaining the film than my semi-coherent rambling."

Trailers usually are put together by marketing to make a film look as good as possible but I think in the case of this film they could not hide how utterly awful this film would be. I don't believe in criticizing a film if I do r see it so I went expecting the worst with the desire to at least be entertained. This was the worst 105 minutes I have spent in a movie theater in a long time. The MCU has gone from being a franchise that had so e great films but mostly solid, reliable and memorable films. Since Avengers: Endgame, only with a couple of exceptions, the MCU has gone completely downhill. With every film, they feel so generic, so done without the care that used to be made them so popular. Now, the difference is like night and day. They have become aggressively lazy and average films. Forgettable. But none of them had been complete failures on every level until The Marvels.There really is no story to talk about here. It is a sequel to Captain Marvel that i admit is one of the pre-Endgame films I liked the least. I didn't think Brie Larson was particularly bad as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel but there was nothing special about her in the role. Here it's obvious she wasn't right for the role. She has no charisma as the character, it felt like she was phoning in the performance. In fact that is the case for everyone in this film. It's a phoned in film. There is not a single character or situation to care about. A villain that is probably the worst ever in the MCU. It's just a series of mediocre action scenes put together with so e exposition dialogue thrown in to pad the runtime. At 105 mi it's it's short by MCU standards but it felt like 3 hours!!!Hands down, the worst MCU film ever!!!Grade: F."

I can't believe this script got a greenlight, let alone a $300 million budget. Speaking of which, where on this earth did all that money go? It certainly is not up on the screen as this is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen. Movies made in the 90s look a thousand times better than this catastrophe. I keep reading articles about why this movie is going to fail and they all got it wrong; three incomprehensibly unlikable leads, a nonsensical script, and a woefully incompetent director are why this movie is such a failure.

                    "content": "The Zone of Interest, the latest film by Jonathan Glazer, is a harrowing and disturbing drama that explores the lives of the Nazi commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, and his wife Hedwig, who live in a house and garden next to the camp. Based on the novel by Martin Amis, the film is a loose adaptation that uses the real names and testimonies of the people involved in the events, rather than fictionalizing them.The film is a masterful exercise in contrast and tension, as it juxtaposes the mundane and domestic scenes of the Höss family with the horrific and unspeakable atrocities happening just over the wall. Glazer avoids showing graphic violence, but instead uses sound, suggestion and implication to create a sense of dread and horror. The film also challenges the audience to confront the banality and complicity of evil, as it shows how the Hösses rationalize, justify and normalize their actions and roles in the genocide.The film features stunning performances by Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel as Hedwig and Rudolf Höss, who portray their characters with nuance and complexity. Hüller is especially remarkable as Hedwig, who oscillates between denial, curiosity, guilt and defiance as she grapples with her situation. The film also boasts a remarkable cinematography by Lukasz Zal, who captures the bleak and oppressive atmosphere of Auschwitz with stark and haunting images. The film's score by Mica Levi is equally haunting and unsettling, creating a mood of anxiety and despair.The Zone of Interest is not an easy film to watch, but it is a powerful and important one. It is a film that does not shy away from confronting the darkest aspects of human nature, but also does not exploit or sensationalize them. It is a film that asks difficult questions, but does not offer easy answers. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends."

                    "content": "An absolutely mesmerizing piece of art that challenges and provokes the audience, while also depicting a morbid yet enticingly original perspective on the most infamous and horrific tragedy of all time. Johnathon Glazer's Zone of Interest is not a film to merely watch, but rather one to be absorbed. A paradoxical film, where the most important and powerful images are the ones we never get to see.The concept of the withholding of art being the overarching meaning behind the work certainly isn't reinventing the wheel, but Glazer's presentation and execution puts a spin on the concept in such a unique and cryptic way, it will have you asking yourself if such an idea can ever be done in cinema again.The \"withholding\" begins with the opening of the film. Before the title is flashed onto screen, the audience is treated to a 3-minute synthetic overture in total darkness. A choice that will have you wondering if the projectionist forgot to take off the camera lid. While from a distance it may come across as a mundane or pretentious decision from an amateur director, Glazer is already subjecting the audience to the ethos of his film. The focus is on what we don't see.As Mica Levi's haunting, Aphex Twin remiscent score comes to a close, we are treated to the first image of the film, the Höss family. And for the next 2 hours, we are treated to only images of the Höss family. Never once do we as an audience get to actually witness the horrors of what lies beyond the concentration camp walls. However, that does not mean we are spared.Throughout the film, we feel the effects of the Holocaust without ever truly seeing it. Whether it be the blood-orange glow of the burnt Jewish bodies from the Auschwitz chimney being cast through the window pane of Hedwig Höss' (Sandra Huëller) upstairs guest room. The dichotomy of the Hoss children's playful laughs paired against the sorrowful howls of the tortured souls of the next door death camp. Or the dust remains of decayed Jewish skeletons dumped into the nearby river, ruining Rudolph Höss' (Christian Friedel) canoe adventure with his children. Suffering is felt at every corner of this film. Glazer masterfully crops out the harsh images of the Holocaust, but keeps them just close enough so their presence is still unavoidable. A feeling of historical tragedy that still rings true today.The film is a slow-burn, to say the least. There's never truly an inciting incident, an overly graphic scene of violence, or even really a definitive plot.Yet that is where the art of this film lies, in its subtlety.By introducing images and story-lines that are never fully realized, finished, or even acknowledged, Glazer keeps the audience on its toes by providing only a short glimpse into this family's life, all paired against the gargantuan looming walls of Auschwitz. We see young romance, joust between siblings, and family values, all without ever really learning anything about the family. We are never directly given names, ages, what their hobbies or interests are. Only minute glances at what middle-upper class German family life in the 40s would be ... next to a death camp of course.Oh yeah, the Höss family's idyllic suburban home with 6 rooms and a garden that rivals that of Francis Hodgson Burnett's, is built directly next to the infamous Auschwitz death camp. A property line that excites the family, Rudolph in particular.Rudolph, or Rudy as his wife likes to call him, is the patriarch of the family. A high-ranking officer for the Third Reich, he is one of the head guards at Auschwitz. He is a cold-blooded methodical man, who focuses on efficiency, and has a true love for his work. His wife on the other hand, Hedwig, is a high-ranking officer in an of herself. She runs the Höss family establishment, caring for 5 rambunctious children, enlisting the help of local girls for household duties, and doing whatever necessary to achieve the dream life she had ever since she was a girl, a big house and family.This description of a traditional working man, a traditional wife and their traditional family doesn't sound like much to chew on, but with the next door screams of the innocent reminding the audience who this family is, the film could not feel more tense. To portray a family of Nazis as just your average boring family, reminiscent of an American family in the 50s, is daring, to say the least. But this is exactly Glazer's intention, to bring a perspective on tragedy we have never seen before. One that, from a distance, doesn't seem harmful. But on a closer inspection, finding that the distance is the harm.Glazer however, doesn't only ever submit the audience to monotonous montages of basic family life, though it is prevalent. He instead uses the effect of monotony to then surprise his audience with choices an ideas that would never be seen in a period piece. Every so often, the film will deliver a cryptic sequence or audio effect that is a complete betrayal of the historical drama formula. The first, and most reoccurring of which, being an inverted color, night vision setting on the camera. Without warning, the film will switch to this bizarre camera setting, breaking away from the established world of the film. This subversion adds to the artistic and innovative vision of Glazer, while also avoiding gimmick.The film also has an incredible use of sound design, straying away from historical drama cliches. Rather than including songs or sounds from the 40s, Glazer utilizes the work of sound designer Johnnie Burns to craft a heavy and electronic approach that adds an incredible depth to the film. The sound bellows throughout the theatre and shakes you to your very core. This choice proves to be another masterful decision by Glazer, as it amplifies an undeniable sense of impending doom and scale that no other design could depict.The Zone of Interest is one of the most intrinsically haunting pieces of art I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Its performances, originality, and lead by Johnathon Glazer undeniably makes it the best from Cannes, and one of the best films I've seen in the past decade, if not the best. Its subtlety, unique perspective, and daring choices creates a breathtaking atmosphere and movie-going experience. It's as impressive as a film can get, and represents a true understanding and mastering of cinema as an art form.10 out of 10."

There is very little soundtrack and it all unfolds at a deliberate pace that is in keeping with Jonathan Glazer's slow-burn, disquieting style. A rigorous sense of order and calm is prevalent throughout.We never actually see any of the Holocaust taking place even though it's right next door. The barbarism and butchery are only apparent from the screams in the distance or from fires at night or smoke during the daytime. The pristine, lush surroundings of this family bely the mass extermination that is taking place in the immediate vicinity. It's a masterful work in which conveys horrible events by leaving them to the imagination.A repeat viewing might be helpful as subtitles in this film are sometimes rapid-fire.

He and wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch."

As a feature film, they are not enough. After the first agonising hour, you just want to scream at the filmmaker: you're no Chantal Akerman, no point in trying, just fly lower and put some graft into it. I was seriously tempted to leave before the end, but I kept hoping against all hope; in truth, the fourth and final idea does land in the penultimate sequence, but you still leave with the impression that this should have been a great film, and yet somehow it ends up being a shallow bore."

                    "content": "Watched this at its premiere in Cannes without any expectations whatsoever. The premise looks interesting: the head of Auschwitz lives a very paradoxically normal life with his family just behind the wall that separates them from the camp. So normal that it's filled with endless scenes of them eating, brushing their teeth, kids playing, parents reading, even sleeping while nothing else happens. Just as exciting as life in the 40's. And... that's it ! Once in a while, you can barely hear an execution or a scream on the other side of the wall while the family hardly notices at all. What is happening then is left to the viewer's imagination. Throw in some experimental, ominous and unfitting electronic music and occasional uninspired video art gimmicks and you've got a movie. There were enough ideas for a 5mn short film but it looks like the director tried his hardest to extend it into a full-length feature by all means. That was definitely not necessary. He even seemed to notice something else HAD to happen so he found something to spike this giant snoozefest a little bit: Will the husband accept to be mutated somewhere else with a higher rank ? His wife doesn't want him to, she's happy with her family life, while he's hesitant and hopes to convince the kommandantur that he can stay where they are. Big suspense. Not. Because nobody cares.This is not a difficult film to watch because of its supposed tension (there is hardly any despite all the efforts - just go spend a weekend in the German or Austrian countryside and you'll feel just the same) but because it's unbelievably boring, uneventful and empty with shockingly stale dialogue (when there is any). Glazer is no Hitchcock, Bergman or Argento. The raving reviews can only come from people who will praise anything related to the horrors of the Holocaust. This film has nothing."

I did wake up when it randomly transitioned to the present day and was confused at first but thought that was one of the stronger parts of the film. I gave it 7 stars because of the earnest effort, the acting (which was boring, but real), and cinematography and locations which were all beautiful. You can't deny it's beautifully shot, but it is literally so boring. I get what the director was going for, attempting to show us how ordinary people can be evil and they are still like everyday people in many ways. But it couldn't hold my engagement. It's definitely an artistic piece and a one time watch. This is a film I'd compare to watching paint dry. I also, didn't know Auschwitz looked like Italian villas?

It also matters exactly what month and year we are in (it seems to begin in summer 43) and this is not made clear to the audience, many of who will now know that Auschwitz was first an agricultural research station, then a camp (Auschwitz I) for Polish political prisoners and then part of the holocaust from June 1942. On Hoss himself, whose autobiography is devoid of all human feeling, the film quite disgracefully shows him throwing up at the prospect of being responsible for the arrival of 700,000 Hungarian Jews, as though he cared about that at all.

In any case showing the top half of the very well built austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I all the time makes it seem like aregular prison. The train sounds in the backrgound are not those of a train slowing down. Hoss is presented at the end as a man with a conscience, throwing up at the prosoect of killing 700,000 hungarians.

At the end, comically, the auschwitz exhibition of jews' suitcases is juxtaposed with photos of Polish political prisoners with no explanation that the suitcases are not theirs.Above all the film is just boring, like Christian Petzold gone wrong."

However the way they are done in 'Dream Scenario' was perfect. This film was a blast.Talk about getting everything out of a concept. The movie starts and you think, okay this is a lot of fun, but where are they going to go from here? Have no fear, they have plenty of tricks up their sleeves and the wild ride continues throughout.The film is hilarious. It contained some of the biggest theatre laughs I've heard in a long time. But it's more than that too. It actually gets quite touching and sad and has some real thought-provoking stuff going on. This was an excellent film. 8/10."

Similar to Adaptation or The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent ,Cage plays a man who needs everyone to know how smart he is in a way that makes him unlikeable slightly, which makes it interesting when life happens to him and the world starts to intergrade him into their dreams for no known reason and it takes an unfair turn that gives a vivid reflection on culture and social media if you ask me.It was an eye opener that made me laugh out loud because the metaphor on social commentary was just so dead on.Greatest Nicolas Cage movie of the year and Reinfeld came out this same year (along with a lot of other Nicolas Cage movies actually)"

                    "content": "Dream Scenario is a really funny look at unexpected fame and how it's impossible to control how others interpret it. A be careful what you wish for story that's a lot stronger when primarily focusing on how fame changes a person than when it delves into cancel culture.Uncomfortable with how his own image has been interpreted, Nicolas Cage is the ideal person for this. He plays the pitiful nature of Paul beautifully and brings none of the Cage rage he's synonymous with, in a nice change of pace. The film also feels aware of Cage's persona, understanding everything is funnier and weirder because it's Nic Cage specifically.Kristoffer Borgli's direction really nails the dream sequences in particular. They're very surreal (obviously), brief and when they start to turn into nightmares they really don't hold back on the violence. It also has the second most hilariously awkward sex scene of recent memory, with Beau Is Afraid being number one which is so fitting since Ari Aster is a producer on this."

The increasingly brilliant Nicholas Cage continues his renaissance following his recent superb performances in Mandy, Pig and The unbearable weight of massive talent. Cage plays a run of the mill university professor who oozes normality. His students take no real notice of him. His former colleagues publish papers in top journals whilst he hasn't even started his book yet. But he's happy enough, if not fulfilled. Then, for no apparent reason, he starts appearing in people's dreams. Not just people who know or have met him. Anyone. And in the dreams they tend to be in difficult positions but he does absolutely nothing. He has no control over this. The first half of the film is hilarious - the whole cinema (the lovely Electric, Birmingham) we're in stitches as we see the dreams played out. And then the second half of the film takes a sinister turn, to reflect a changing nature of the dreams. And whilst the comedy ends at this point, the drama begins. Whilst the first half is the better half it would be wrong to say the second is disappointing. Cage is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors. Long may it continue. 8 out of ten."

                    "content": "So, having heard nothing about this film, never mind seeing a trailer or preview for it, I went into this one blind with only the synopsis to go by.The film stars Nicolas Cage as a hapless family man who finds his life turned upside down when millions of strangers suddenly start seeing him in their dreams. When his nighttime appearances take a nightmarish & sinister turn, Paul is forced to navigate his newfound stardom.I found the film to be bizarre. I'm still right now trying to process what I watched. It was pretty engaging despite being dragged out in places & kept you wanting to know more & why the main lead was being dreamed about & of course, why the dreams about him turn sinister & violent.The film's story & concept is definitely unique & did remind me (& is funnily enough parodied here) like A Nightmare On Elm Street. The horror aspects (what little there was) were good & there's some awkward, yet funny & humourous scenes to be had.What annoyed me about the film was the lack of explanation as to why people were dreaming about Paul Matthews & of course why the dreams turned sour.Moreover, the unlike-ability of the characters in the film, the family members, the students, his friends & others treating him like he was a criminal. Couldn't these people in the film tell the difference between fantasy & reality? Were they that gullible & dumb to not know the difference? The way he was treated in the film really made me feel sorry for the guy. It was both annoying & hard to watch to be honest. Not to mention they way they blamed him for something that was completely out of his control. Unbelievable.The film itself was pretty depressing in a lot of areas & towards the end we didn't get any reconciliation of the characters that treated him badly & continued to blame him for the nightmares they were having. The film did have a decent runtime of 1 hour & 36 minutes (96 minutes) & not bad pacing despite being sluggish in areas.Overall, it's a mixed bag this one. There's some good points & bad. It's an out there type of film which is neither good or bad, but ok & bizarre. Judge for yourself when you come to see it.6/10."

The slow destruction of the life of an ordinary man for reasons which were completely outside his control was well-conceived, well-plotted and well acted. Nicholas Cage's performance was pitch perfect.To an extent, this film can be seen as a satirical condemnation of social media fame and cancel culture, though that's secondary to the theme of mounting paranoia - both from Prof Matthews and the wider world.The fact that this film started out as a project of Ari Aster is no surprise, as it has much in common with Beau is Afraid - notably the hapless and powerless central character and some surreal and blackly comic moments.Then, in the last fifteen minutes or so, the film loses its way. A new element is brought in which pretty much undermines what had gone before. The result wasn't bad, exactly, but seemed to belong in a different film. I think it would've been better if the film had had the courage of its convictions and followed Prof Matthews to his logical fate.For all that, it's an interesting film, and I would urge you to see it."

I don't think I've ever seen dreams portrayed so realistically. It also really palpably got that thing where a dream seems so terrifying just to you, then when you tell someone about it out loud it doesn't seem as scary as it was when you were in it. Just beautifully directed by Kristoffer Borgli. Every single time I see a Nicolas Cage film I think no one else could've played this role, & I think that's really special.For fans of Everything Everywhere All At Once, Being John Malkovich, Vanilla Sky."

This all happens in this movie, with Cage as the driving force.Cage totally look unrecognisable as the professor, bald head, gruff beard, funny walk, he really goes for it. And has too. Everyone else is collateral damage and the enemy. It's a cleaver film on what is going on in the world and media right now, spun into this strange world, which I would not want to a part off, but we are, like it or not.Mixed bag on this one, it's good, but will divide everyone, and people will see things differently, which is the point."

A timid professor who has awkward experiences almost daily gets to steal the limelight when he starts to appear as an impassive spectator in other people's dreams. He enjoys the fame, which seems to flutter his immediate family. And so starts a ride to uncharted territory, speaking a lot about the current state of affairs around us. Cancel culture, 'gram influencers, AI, mind implanting - everything gets a nod in this superbly structured film that I could relate with so much. Nicolas Cage is so good as the central character, almost making me feel that he was enacting me on onscreen. The right amount of awkwardness, perfect look and air, and an honest outlook. This is the best film I watched at the 2023 MAMI Mumbai Film Festival so far."

                    "content": "I must say first that Dream Scenario is not at all what I expected it to be. After falling in love with writer/director Kristoffer Borgli's previous film Sick Of Myself, then exploring all of his recent short films on YouTube, I thought I had a grasp on what to expect from Dream Scenario, but I was off and that makes it a bit more challenging to form a solid opinion on. One thing is for certain though: regardless of how much you feel like you are enjoying the film as you are watching it, this is the kind of movie that will have you thinking and talking about it, trying to find all the analogies, for some time afterwards. Though my girlfriend left the theater a total of 4 times due to anxiety, she pulled even more apt metaphor out of it than I did when it was over - it gave us a lot to discuss, far more than the average movie.The overall tone was way different than I was expecting. The trailer had me thinking this would be a quirky adventure into dreams and personalities, but Dream Scenario is FAR more horror-leaning than I'd imagined. Having seen Borgli's previous work in combination with the choice to have Nicolas Cage as the lead, this really threw me off. Once you get into it, it often feels like the work of Ari Aster, which made a lot more sense to me when the ending credits hit and I saw that Ari Aster had produced it. Apparently Aster was originally set to direct this film with Adam Sandler as the lead, but after Sick Of Myself did well, Aster pushed to get Borgli in the director's chair for A24. Overall, the movie has its signature Borgli moments but it definitely feels like a combination of Borgli, Aster, and A24 vibes rather than simply a Borgli piece.There is not nearly as much comedy as I thought there would be, and most of it is very subdued. I felt like I was laughing more than anyone else in the theater, and it was not much, to be honest. Laughs are simply not one of the primary focuses of the film, in my opinion. And on the subject of atypical focuses, there are hardly fleshed-out characters in this movie at all - they are more like archetypes or vessels that allow the themes to be explored. The way Cage's character works is that he is an effective \"every man\" in the sense that he's not really likable, but also not especially unlikable - he could be just about any average person, and that's the point. The real \"main character\" is society and their response to what's happening in a collective manner.While it's not the most riveting or throughly enjoyable film, it is incredibly original and does seem to have a lot to say underneath it's surface of \"simplicity\". I was expecting something in the realm of Charlie Kaufman, but what I got was perhaps something I can't compare to almost anything else. At one point in the film, there is a book that is released, and when it does the character who wrote it exclaims \"It was supposed to be called Dream Scenario\", then the publisher responds, \"Is there something wrong with the new title, I Am Your Nightmare?\". I feel like this is a fitting summary of my entire experience with this film. I'm not sure if that was all set up on purpose, as a \"haha\" at the viewer's expense, but knowing Borgli and his specific style of genius-level trolling, I'd say he knew exactly what he was doing."

His wife Janet (Julianne Nicholson) loves him and appreciates him, but sometimes appears to be an enabler to his own neurosis. When one day people start to tell him that he appears in their dream. Complete strangers.This conceit is a remarkable absurd moment that rockets him into a roller coaster of fame, acceptance and eventual downfall.If you were to put this in context of society, you could say the social media influencers who go viral and inevitably create haters. These are the most dangerous people.At times, it's frustrating to deal with Paul. Since he constantly pitches a book he never intends to write. To a lot of \"creators\" this is painful to watch. A person so devoid of ambition he requires others to antagonize him into action. He relies on victimhood in a sense. And hasn't concluded how unfair life is.This miraculous event shoots him into a world he is unfamiliar with. Where people now \"see\" him. Which he believes will give him the validation he craves. But it backfires when he doesn't do all the right things (the things we would do with this level of fame).The failure of this film is that it does require him to constantly be a punching bag. While a person with common sense would bend to the masses for a specific reason, Paul tends to do the opposite because the plot wants it to happen. This needs to happen for the story to spiral on him. There is no reason for his stubborn behavior. But this could just be a behavioral thing we are suppose to see as a character flaw. To the viewer, it could be REALLY frustrating.The tone of the film is very much like \"Eternal Sunshine Of A Spotless Mind\" Not necessarily the story, but the tone. It is quirky and sometimes laugh out loud funny. Thought I'd never say that. His adventures are silly but fascinating. A smarter socially wiser man would slingshot the fame into something more. Many people who struggle in life would take the Sprite endorsement.In the end, it happens regardless of his efforts. Or lack of.The last part of the movie is a bit rushed. It has very little to do with him and more to do with us as a society. We take a bizarre event and monetize it. We fall for the stupidity of technology. And so forth. It taps into the delusion of getting rich through attention seeking. That part falls a little short. In a longer film, perhaps this would be integrated smoother.This is, in my opinion, Nic Cage's best role. I go back into his filmography and haven't seen anything that required him this level of heavy lifting. It's impressive that he embodies Paul without having his normal wild Cage-ism which I am grateful for. His career is very eclectic but somehow this film fits him like a well tailored suit.A must watch of 2023."

This is a very traditional \"Nicolas Cage\" drama, through and through. It has an air of humor and awkwardness throughout all of it due to his performance, but overall, there's a bigger picture behind it. Oddly enough, in a lot of ways it felt like a very late companion piece to Cage's performance in The Weather Man, a movie where his character also deals with consequences of fame while dealing with a crumbling family life. The biggest difference is that Dream Scenario leans farther into the consequences of fame that celebrities never asked for and that consumers fail to understand because of the media. This is a very sad and upsetting movie that I would say accurately captures that feeling of not having control of your life. It's definitely among the best films I've seen this year."

I presume is an analagy to how 'the woke' arbitarily cancel others with a nod to hypocrisy at the end where ideas are then embraced.Other than that, I'm not really sure what this film is about and in the last 15 minutes are so I was hoping it would end soon.Would I watch it again ? NoIt's quite a dissmal / dark film (in my opinion).

                    "content": "It has been a while since I went to the theatre and had such a great time. Dream Scenario is one of Studio A24's latest theatrical releases and it may just be their cleverest, smartest, and hilarious film of the year. The ads for this film intrigued me, but I did t expect the level of filmmaking craft put into such a whacky concept. It won't be for everyone, like many A24 films are, but if you're a film lover, I think you may love this one as I did. So let's dive into this bizarre film.Paul Matthew (Nicolas Cage) is a boring family man who wants nothing more in life than to have his book published. Out of nowhere, he begins to appear in the dreams of strangers. In these dreams, he does nothing but stands there and observe. This eventually turns into thousands, if not millions of people dreaming about him. This very quickly gives him fame, but when dreams become nightmares, it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Paul. The film's final act also deals with a lot of social commentary on our real world and virtual world in a very clever way. With the actual serious plot at hand aside, let's dive into why I had so much fun as well.Having liked Nicolas Cage as an actor for my whole life, I'll admit he has made many questionable acting choices and taken some very questionable roles over the last decade or two. He's much more out there these days, but I still always love it when he releases a new film. Well, this might be his best performance in many, many years. He brought the emotional weight of the character to the screen when the film required him to do so, but I'm also not sure if I've ever laughed this hard at a single performance in quite some time. From a scene involving a fart to his perfect line deliveries, I was laughing from start to finish. This film is entirely on his shoulders and he just ran with it. I don't think he knew he was making such an overall great film though.The visual depictions of each of the dreams in this film are all very creative and what they mean/turn into later was, quite frankly, genius. Director Kristoffer Borgli seems to have only worked mostly on short films, but this film alone will have me glancing at his small catalogue and awaiting his next big project because he has a promising future. He also wrote this film, which is why I have so much hope for him. He took an incredible concept and took it past the finish line and the final product is glorious. It was his vision and his vision completely worked for me.To wrap things up, this is an incredibly made film all around, especially taking into account that it was made for a very small budget. I will admit that the only reason I'm not saying it's nearly perfect or giving it a perfect score is for the way it concludes. The final act worked for me and blended well with the rest of the film, but I found the very final scene to be quite abrupt. Everything comes to a conclusion but I felt a scene or two more could've made the ending land slightly better for me. I can't quite put my finger on it because the entire film is superb, so I'll simply say I'm selfish and wanted a little more. Dream Scenario is now playing in theatres. It's weird and I absolutely recommend it."

                    "content": "Just back from the theater. My rating of 5/10 really reflects more my personal reaction to it, rather than how well it was done and acted. It's advertised as a comedy, but there aren't really many laughs, and I wouldn't even call it a black comedy. As we watch Paul Matthews' (Nicolas Cage) life slowly disassemble through no fault of his own, it wanders fully into the horror regime. Not some crude slasher type of thing -- stylisically this is closer to what Alfred Hitchcock might have made with the same material. And personally I just don't react well to horror -- there are twenty different things I'd rather do with my time, thanks. If I hadn't been with friends, I might not have sat through it all.Not that it's a bad production. On the contrary, it's well acted (and thus effective) and Nic Cage displays all his considerable acting skills to the full. Matthews is a sort of dumpy middle-aged professor at some small college who's a failed researcher and a rather ordinary teacher. Everything about him is ordinary. He's not dislikable but not terribly interesting or likable either, and is just generally ineffectual at everything at either work or home. He's not someone you would want to spend a lot of time with. (Paradoxically, Cage is so good at conveytng Paul's lackluster life and inner nature that he actually makes us less interested to watch!) Paul likes the momentary fame of being at the center of this unique communal dream phenomenon, but when it takes a violent turn (in the dreams, that is) he doesn't seem to know what to do, gives in to his buried rage, and ends up participating in his own destruction.There's lots of satire of modern life, like cancel culture, New Age woo-woo thinking, the emptiness of suburbia, monetization and corporatization of practically anything, and me-first attitudes -- but I felt like these were secondary to the main thread of horror/tragedy. Sorry, but not for me. The thing is that if some explanation had been given for why this communal-dream phenomenon was happening, and thus what to do about it, it would have been more in the direction of a science-fiction movie. I might have found that more interesting. When word gets around that this obscure person is appearing in all kinds of peoples' dreams, researchers would jump on it and treat it as a huge puzzle to be solved -- something that would reveal much about the brain and collective unconscious and so forth. There's no sign that any of that is happening here, it's all focussed on the reactive effects on Paul and his life. In the end I'm not sure what to take away from this thing."

However, in his third feature outing, writer-director Kristoffer Borgli succeeds for the most part when it comes to tackling such an imposing task. This offbeat tale of tenured but underappreciated university professor (Nicolas Cage) takes viewers on a wild ride through the diverse realms of fame, metaphysics, cancel culture, unrelenting group think, and unexpressed, underpursued desire, and the downside consequences of each. All of this comes about when the middle-aged everyman protagonist inexplicably begins showing up in the dreams of countless people, many of whom he doesn't even know. This curious oneiric anomaly - an inspired metaphor for one's presence on social media and in the public eye - quickly transforms him into an overnight viral media sensation, one that starts off with a generous showering of attention and lustful admiration but that almost as quickly leads him to become a scorned put-upon pariah. He swiftly becomes more than just yesterday's news; he turns into the object of a targeted campaign of cancel culture, hate speech and unapologetic ostracism. And, ironically, it all stems from something he never wanted nor asked for in the first place (at least in the form it ultimately took). From the foregoing description, it might sound like the filmmaker has tried to overstuff this vehicle with far too much material for viewers to process and comprehend, and there are points in the story (especially in the last half hour) where a good case could be made for that argument. However, in telling this allegorical fable, the director manages to keep the narrative's ideas distinctly sorted and in context to drive home his message, a powerful cautionary tale about the point we've collectively reached as a society with respect to these powerful and potentially damaging matters and practices. These are notions that we all need to hear but seldom do because of all the noise surrounding us that prevents us from hearing the music because of all the notes. For all this seriousness, however, \"Dream Scenario\" is loaded with hilarious, laugh-out-loud humor and fine performances all around (especially Cage and Michael Cera as an empty-headed, self-absorbed brand management expert), complemented with skillful film editing and carefully selected incidental shots that effectively punctuate the mood of many scenes. The script is generally solid, too, though it begins to stray somewhat from the material that works best in the final act, and there are a few graphically violent sequences that sensitive viewers should be wary of. On balance, though, this is the kind of production that should be made in greater numbers in an age where so many of us have lost touch with reason, our existence and ourselves. Maybe watching an offering like this could help us all sit up, think and get back on track while we still can."

I love how creative the concept was, and that Cage took this role. He's fantastic, not over-emoting, not putting on some strange accent, just playing this frustrated, awkward guy to a tee. There are lots of funny moments, maybe none better than when he finds himself in the apartment of a woman young enough to be his daughter and she's coming on to him.Michael Cera is also brilliant as the leader of a trio at a company called Thoughts? Who seek to monetize the professor's notoriety, in conflict with his wishes to get an academic book published (one which, tellingly, he hasn't even started writing). In an interesting twist, when the professor's mood turns to frustration borne out of humiliation, his appearance in other people's dreams turns to violent nightmares. I kind of thought there might be a \"third act\" relative to what people dreamed about, but maybe its absence was an aspect of the film's originality, and how hard it is to pin down.Instead, the film begins to riff on cancel culture, as the professor finds himself going from acclaim to being a pariah, and because of things completely out of his control. He's like the zebra he's talked about in his lectures, sticking its neck out from the herd and getting noticed by predators. He vents his frustration about the over-use of the word \"trauma\" by the younger generation, and how social media, a milieu he's not very familiar with, is now destroying him. He's not the most sympathetic figure in the world, but how powerless and crushingly average he is makes him feel like a representative of one form or another. Along the way, there is also an amusing bit on those who seek to harness whatever power the professor had (which is never explained) to advertise or become dream influencers.Overall, it's a little depressing and doesn't hit a homerun or anything, but I found it inventive and engaging throughout."

Brett (Tim Meadows) is the dean at the university; Richard (Dylan Baker) is a colleague who is much more outgoing and popular.The movie, somewhat in the spirit of \"Twilight Zone,\" suddenly has both acquaintances and strangers to Paul having frequent dreams about Paul. Initially, he is simply a bystander to dramatic events in the dreams, but gradually, the dreams change in a more sinister direction. The movie follows changes in people's reactions to Paul and the impact of these changes on Paul and his marriage. Events spiral until, finally, entrepreneurship takes over with its own effect on Paul.\"Dream Scenario\" is a clever idea, and it especially works in college towns where we've all known professors with some of Paul's characteristics.

He only really chews up the scenery in the dreams and once in real life when students vandallse his car. Interesting the way his appearances in dreams move on from him being just an observer of people in violent/threatening scenarios to the poinr where the film pivots into horror and he attacks, strangles, stabs people in what have now become nightmares. He goes from having disinterested students in his class to being their favourite professor but then gets effectively cancelled by them. Their dreams/nightmares become their lived experience. An interesting critique of cancel culture infuses the film, sometimes explicit but also implicit in other scenes. A Hipster PR firm firm is also used to satirise the industry, they want him to advertise Sprite and get into Obama's dreams. As he turns from hero to zero they want to push him at the Jordan Petersen demographic. Paul Matthews is basically a frumpy middle aged male, always in an anorak, he has to be asked to take it off when he;s being seduced. He holds grudges and perhaps unfairly, even irrationally believes that an old grad school colleague has stolen his ideas. An interesting observation of the male midlife crisis taken to a Fortean level. See this film! Written and Directed by Kristoffer Borgli. 8.5/10."

David Bowie's 1975 song \"Fame\" has a line, \"Fame ... what you get is no tomorrow\", and that stuck with me during the second half of this terrific and wild film from Norwegian writer-director Kristoffer Borgli (SICK OF MYSELF, 2022). Borgli not only tackles the issue of sudden fame and the weight that goes with it, but he also comments on ego and today's cancel culture. Subtext runs throughout a film that feels descended from the mind of Charlie Kaufman and/or Spike Jonze.Oscar winner Nicolas Cage is perfectly cast as Paul Matthews, a bland Evolutionary Biology professor, living a satisfactory life with his wife Janet (the always strong Julianne Nicholson) and their two daughters Sophie (Lily Bird) and Hannah (Jessica Clement). As for his career, Paul, always dressed in a sweater and green jacket, is frumpy and awkward and an undistinguished faculty member who speaks frequently of writing a book, though he never actually writes anything.Things change quickly for Paul as he begins showing up in people's dreams. As in his life, Dream-Paul doesn't do much other than 'be there', but as the number of people who experience this grows exponentially, Paul becomes a celebrity ... leading to the publicity machine we've witnessed many times in real life. Basically, Paul goes viral. Cage masters the delivery of this line: \"Have you been dreaming about me?\", and it's the point where we recognize he is delivering an outstanding performance. When do-nothing dream-Paul turns aggressive and violent in folk's dreams (now nightmares), his experience shifts dramatically. Cancel culture kicks in and Paul becomes an outcast or pariah. Filmmaker Borgli could draw from numerous real-life situations where teachers have been dismissed for absurd reasons ... OK, maybe not as absurd as actions in a dream, yet the concept is the same.Borgli was surely inspired by Spike Jonze's excellent ADAPTATION (2002), which featured Nic Cage in a dual role (as Kaufman and his fictional brother). Although this isn't technically a dual role, Cage certainly gets to carve a wide swath through the film and through dreams ... and he appears to be having a great time doing so. Supporting work is provided by Dylan Baker, Tim Meadows, Dylan Gelula, and Kate Berlant. Michael Cera has a humorous sequence as a PR agent at a marketing firm that is trying to cash in on Paul's newfound fame as a \"dream influencer\". We even see capitalism at work in a further attempt to create an industry out of this flukey situation.The brilliance of the film stems from Borgli presenting this as an entertaining comedy-horror film with 'everyman' Paul at the center. It's a clever idea that is not-so-subtle in its willingness to show us how easily cancel culture can spin out of control and how monetizing our addiction to attention can go wrong. One specific thing that I admired in Borgli's approach was how he made Paul a normal guy, and yet, he's one of those who always believes someone has wronged him or stolen his work - despite the fact that he never actually produces any work or takes his own risk. There is so much to like about this film, not the least of which is one of Nicolas Cage's best ever performances (even in David Byrne's oversized suit).Opens in theaters on December 1, 2023."

                    "content": "DREAM SCENARIO is a very interesting movie that could generate a lot of post-viewing discussion. It asks some interesting questions about celebrity & \"cancel culture.\" It did occur to me afterwards that the movie is completely ridiculous and posits a scenario that is beyond impossible, and thus, spending a lot of time talking about its implications seems a bit silly. But, I err on the side of it being a worthwhile intellectual exercise. To say nothing of being a terrific showcase for Nicolas Cage.Cage is Paul Matthews, an aging, balding (and apparently always cold because he wears gigantic, ill-fitting coats throughout the film) tenured professor at a modest college. His students pay little attention to him (even though, to be honest, it seems like he's a more interesting professor than many I experienced myself). He leads a frustrating professional life. Early in the film, he has lunch with an very distant colleague who is preparing to publish a paper that touches on subjects that Matthews worked on decades ago. He feels these topics still somehow belong to him, and wants some credit for the paper. He mentions that he's working on a book on the topic...but it turns out he hasn't actually started writing the thing. It's an idea he has and apparently has had for many years. He's a guy who imagines doing great or interesting things, but it will never happen for him. We meet his loving wife (Julianne Nicholson, always under-rated) and his doting daughters. From the viewer's perspective, he's a bit of schlub. An uninspiring instructor, eaten up by his own failures, and sadly unable to see that his great family really means he's got it pretty darn good. Nice house. Nice kids. Nice wife.But he's a bit clueless. And when he suddenly starts appearing in the dreams of millions of people around the world, he becomes a clueless celebrity (or at least, cultural phenomena). His classroom is full of people who want a selfie with him. He's on the news. He's written about. He's beloved. And he's done nothing to deserve the positive accolades. For some strange reason, he is a background character in the dreams of millions of strangers. He just hovers there, really doing nothing. But just the fact that he's at the center of this weird thing makes him popular. And when talent agents come calling, he sees his opportunity to get a book deal.But then, things go abruptly wrong, and he goes from saint to demon overnight. None of it is his fault, but he's suddenly a pariah. And he handles it very, very badly...putting at risk everything good in his life.It's all so unfair. Paul did NOTHING to make these dreams happen. The \"character\" he is in the dreams bears no resemblance to his true persona. He is right to rail against his vilification. Yet his own unpleasant character traits tee us up to NOT sympathize with him. Does he have it coming? Did his own flaws somehow taint his benign dream persona? Why doesn't the public understand that the dream Paul and the real Paul have nothing to do with each other?It's all very interesting, and Cage makes it all matter thanks to the best performance he's given in some time. With this movie and the excellent, over-looked PIG...Cage demonstrates his true acting chops. Yes, he's delightful in THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF MASSIVE TALENT, but even in well-received films like THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE, his performances are over-the-top and even unhinged.Enjoyable...absolutely. But fine acting? No. He's always a bit broad in his performances, but DREAM SCENARIO harnesses his energy and spins Paul Matthews into a complex character we can understand and feel things about. The script is tight and energetic and clever and funny. The supporting cast (again, special kudos to Nicholson) is on the right wavelength. And the questions the film asks are very relevant in our time of social media, overnight sensations and overnight demonizations. It's a fun film on the surface, very much worth it for Cage's well-done work...but it also rewards some reflection and discussion. I heartily recommend it."

After a wonderfully joyful start it veers into darker territory though!What supposedly starts out as a quirky comedy, halfway through really flipped sides and became a great tale of the vulnerabilities of those who are famous and stand out from the crowd. It's a character portrait and an allegory firstmost, \"disguised\" as a quirky comedy.Beware: this is not a laugh out loud comedy (although still quite witty and really quirky), but it is a very intelligent allegory, best suited for an arthouse movie crowd I guess.The story is about lots of people suddenly having dreams about a boring professor (Nicholas Cage) who appears in their dreams, wherein he basically is doing nothing, just passing by. What's going on here?I wont start saying (again) that Nicholas Cage is back, because this truly brilliant actor has been on a lucky streak of several actor's gems in a row for some years now! And this is another one of his very best acting performances!Highly recommended for the art house movie fans of quirky and intelligent comedies. Memories of the best of Charlie Kaufman's work (\"Being John Malkovich\", \"Adaptation\") come to mind when watching this wonderful trip of a story.I APPLAUD the writer AND director Kristoffer Borgli for writing this marvellous allegory, brilliantly directed, with every techinical detail (photography, editing, sound) being simply superb.What a trip. What joy to watch. So dreamlike, yet still so real and heartfelt!

Unfortunately, Dream Scenario is a classic case of most of the good bits being in the trailer.Once the film has established its quirky set-up -- college professor Paul Matthews becomes a sensation when he randomly starts to appear in strangers' dreams and is courted by a marketing agency keen to exploit his 'exposure'-- it doesn't really go anywhere interesting, its commentary on the potential pitfalls of fame, in particular the scourge of cancel culture, topical but not exactly profound.Cage is as loopy as always, and undeniably fun to watch, as his character initially enjoys his newfound celebrity, but has to deal with fear and mistrust when his night-time appearances take a darker turn; but his latest off-beat performance in a career littered with such roles can only take us so far, and the plot loses traction in the final act as it introduces a sci-fi element, borne out of Paul Matthews' inexplicable experience: a device that enables anyone to enter another person's dreams."

It was an Excellent Performance that Services the Plot so well.4. The \"Sex Dream Fart Reenactment and Climax\" scene had some of the Audience Members in the Screening Hilariously and Silently \"Breathy Cackling\". Me myself, I was in tears at how Hilarious that scene was, wiping my eyes and trying to pull myself together as it went on. It is one of the Most Well Calibrated comedic Moments I've ever Witnessed. 😂5. Towards the Final Act, I loved how it just kept Going on, and I thought to myself \"I wonder what the resolution to this film will be\"?6.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering \"Can I take my kid to see this?\". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The \"twist\" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think \"Is this a horror film?\". It's not \"balls-to-the-wall\" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies."

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF."

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline \"cheese\", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six.

Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole \"kidnapped little brother\" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film."

It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie.

The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better."

The way the virtual world was brought to life was brilliant: the costumes, set design, cinematography, etc., were top-notch.But what on earth was going on with the story? Something about a brother being kidnapped and a bunch of 'ghost children' ending up in the robots? I still don't fully get what the hell it was on about.With a better story this could have been a really good film. Also needed a stronger horror element, and more of a 'claustrophobic' feel.It's a shame they didn't go down the route of the game, having the protagonist shut in the security room, trying to keep away from the robots. One of the creepiest things about FNAF is the robots moving without being seen and turning up somewhere else on the security screens, but not once was that used.This film had all the bells and whistles, but it forgets the most important facet: a gripping narrative."

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation."

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience."

After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics.

He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he \"still had control of them \" at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action."

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on."

                    "content": "Fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series were eagerly awaiting the release of the film adaptation, but unfortunately, the results were less than stellar. The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with."

(Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, \"That's just a theory...\". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final \"fight\" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back."

                    "content": "Five Nights at Freddy's is a new horror film arrangement and written in part by Emma Tammi, director of The Wind. The films are based on the horror game of the same name.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) works as a night security guard at the local pizzeria Freddy Fazbear. He has to work here for five nights, but during these nights he discovers that something is wrong with the pizzeria's animatronic costumes. So he begins to learn about a dark secret.This game adaptation works better for people who are familiar with the horror game, because it contains nice references and other easter eggs that link back to the game. People who don't know the game will not really understand these things.For a game known for its jump scares, designed to frighten and further frighten players, the film strangely has almost none of these horror moments. This film sometimes seems more meaningful to younger viewers of just sixteen. For older viewers, the film is not scary and if they know nothing about the game, the film may be more unclear, or overcome separately.The location of the famous pizzeria from the game seems positive, especially for people who are familiar with it. Since most movie studios didn't use CGI for this movie, the animatronic costumes of the Fazbear crew have to be brought into the movie. Jim Henson's Orphan Shop was responsible for the Fazbear crew. They are performed by puppeteers and stunt artists. This will get her across.However, the story of the film can be a problem for viewers of the film. In addition to the story around the pizzeria, it also tells the story of the main character. In addition to a dark past, he also has a struggle to retain the rights to raise his youngest sister. These storylines do not always correspond well with each other, which means that the film can sometimes be a bit unclear and difficult to overcome.This inferior script sometimes makes it difficult for the actors to come across well. Josh Hutcherson sometimes remains a bit vague. He does come across well as an older brother who tries to take good care of his sister. His sister is played by Piper Rubio, who delivers some decent acting for a novice actress. The brother and sister actors have a well-known bond together. Matthew Lillard also plays a small role in the film, which he portrays appropriately. After his previous acting work in Scream and Scooby-Doo, it is also nice to see him again in this horror film."

It already served as an inspiration for the much better The Banana Splits Movie in 2019.What should be a gory comedy horror movie. Five Nights at Freddy's is a more serious movie about grief and loss masquerading as a horror film.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a security guard with many issues. He cannot get over the fact that his brother was abducted when he was a kid and was never found. Mike is unable to hold a steady job, hooked on pills and has anger issues.Mike cares for his withdrawn younger sister Abby and faces a custody battle over her with his aunt Jane.His career advisor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) gets him a job as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Mike reluctantly accepts as he needs the job to keep custody of his sister.Only when he dozes off at work, it sort of amplifies the events leading up to his brother's abduction in his dreams. He also meets Vanessa Shelly, a cop who seems to know more about the history of the park.Then there are the creepy animatronic mascots. They come alive and kill some delinquents sent by aunt Jane to damage the diner, so Mike would get fired. The mascots later take an interest with Abby as they seem to bond with her when Mike brought her to work one day.This is such an uneven film, I though it was two different kind of movies that got meshed together. The horror parts only comes alive much later. Even then it is tame in order to be a family friendly scary movie.The similar themed Willy's Wonderland was more fun with a silent Nicolas Cage causing mayhem."

The plot was so poorly thought out and cringy with almost no horror aspects at all. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, which from what I understand is what the video games were, but it ended up being a mystery movie kind of. The acting is horrible and the screen writing didn't help them. The interactions between the characters are so unrealistic and their emotions are so random and extreme. One character is so unnecessarily secretive it's frustrating. I'm really sorry if you're a fan of this franchise and I know you probably really want to like this movie but be realistic about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 or 2 stars is because the animatronics look really good, for the VERY limited time you see them."

It is not your typical Christian movie, with all the preachy cheesy acting and low-budget constraints. This is a Hollywood-quality movie, with a cast filled with A-list actors and a crew filled with professionals.The movie isn't perfect, but its flaws are limited to some of the cuts being awkward and the CGI being better in some scenes than in others. Luckily, for most of the movie, the cinematography and special effects are just as great as the rest of the movie.Prepare to cry at the ending, as it is extremely powerful - and I've seen a lot of emotional movies, so I should know! You will not regret watching this movie; it is without a doubt the best movie Angel Studios has made yet. Don't listen to the negative Rotten Tomatoes reviews - most of which are written by atheists who hate any movie that please Him; go watch the movie yourself.

Clearly, these did not diminish the rating I gave.First, I would have Kevin as being more righteous (Job was righteous in his generation). Second, I would tone down the multiverse stuff (but I'm 61, so what do I know). Finally, (big spoiler alert) I would not have erased Kevin and Molly's son.I highly recommend this movie.

Films that ask questions, that challenge us and provoke us and compel us to explore inner depths, those are the films we find ourselves contemplating and discussing long after the final credits have rolled.The Shift is one of these films.Written and directed by Brock Heasley and coming to us through Angel Studios, the production company best known for the groundbreaking television series, The Chosen, The Shift stays true to the spirit of its writer, director, and producers. It asks deep questions and makes bold decisions, pushing deep into a genre that is woefully under-represented in Christian art. While Marvel relentlessly releases film after film of cookie-cutter pablum, and the formerly beloved Star Wars franchise vomits out enough inferior recycled content to make us scream, \"enough already,\" Heasley and Angel Studios have created what will hopefully be will be the first of many original films-movies with that smaller independent touch that allow us to experience something new and engage in a dialog of issues vital to the human condition. This is an area where Science Fiction has historically been there to challenge us, yet most modern Hollywood blockbusters have abandoned that aspect while Christian films have frankly not even made an attempt.Until now.Led by outstanding performances from Neal McDonough, Kristoffer Polaha, and Elizabeth Tabish, The Shift will take you into a series of dystopian worlds, engaging in a universe-jumping ride in which the lead character, Kevin, contends with societal oppression, personal betrayal, and his most primal fears. Can Kevin find the courage and strength to fight through it all and find his way back to the woman he loves?The Shift is not a perfect film. There is a large amount of character- and world-building to be covered in 115 minutes, which leaves certain plot points and motivations underserved. While ambitious, the story could have benefited from a narrower focus. However, The Shift is highly entertaining, innovative, and thought provoking. It will engage you and challenge you. Brock Heasley and Angel Studios have created something fresh and important-a courageous, innovative, and risk-taking movie that requires a response, welcoming us into a genre and drawing us into a conversation we have too often avoided."

When I learned this is a father based movie, my opinion of it doesn't change at all. This is a well acted, carefully crafted story with solid performances by its lead actors. In fact, this thrill ride is better than a lot of overpriced Hollywood blockbusters that failed to deliver this year."

Brock Heasley created and directed a beautiful, thought provoking, leave you on the edge of your seat story with depth, hope and light. You will definitely leave the theater feeling good with a lot to think about and chew on.Kristoffer Polaha plays Kevin Garner. He brings his all to this role and leaves nothing on the table. You truly feel and experience what Kevin is going through. If you only know him from Hallmark, you are in for an amazing ride. He is one of the most versatile and talented actors around. I'm so glad that so many get the opportunity to see and experience his talent.Neal McDonough plays the Benefactor. This guy does a fantastic job at being a bad guy. This is my first time seeing him on screen and I was blown away. He brought truth to how the enemy comes in and doesn't let up.Elizabeth Tabish's portrayal of Molly Garner is stunning and beautiful.To be honest, from the leads to the extras everyone brought their A game and knocked it out of the park.This film brings so much hope and light. It's a beautiful reminder that even in our darkest moments there is still good, light, and hope to found in the world. We are not our circumstances or the \"bad\" we have done.Although this film is labeled as a Faith based Sci-fi film, and yes that element is there, it subtle and not in your face preachy. There is something in this film for everyone. We all need hope and want to feel good about the things we watch. This film definitely delivers that. It is a must see. If possible see it more than once. The more you see it the more Easter eggs you uncover and you gain a better understanding of the story.Oh one last thing. The music! Amazing! The placement of 'Oh My God' was absolutely brilliant."

Go in to be entertained but also to think about some of the themes and concepts they use.I know some people say it is dark - but isn't that how the world is? But it is not, it shows the light in the darkness of the world. Watch how Kevin brings light into the desperate world around him. We can all do that."

Kristoffer Polaha and Elizabeth Tabish performed perfectly not just as their characters but also their alternate versions, which showcases their talent well.

I really loved this film and I can't wait to actually see it on the big screen. It was not at all religious. Anyone could see this film and glean something if they watch with anticipation and expecting the unexpected. The first 5 minutes I was unsure where they were headed, but after that I was intrigued all the way through. It was unlike anything I've ever seen and I was continually excited about what was going to happen next. There was an allegory for sure of the story of Job, but in a very cool yet subtle way. If you're highly visual like me, you'll love the feel of the film. The cinematography drew me in, but hands down the role of Kevin, played by Kris Polaha was amazing! He blew me away. Molly, played by Elizabeth Tabish was the ultimate leading lady! The energy between her and Kevin was captured perfectly. There was a lot of emotion in the film and Kris and Elizabeth nailed every scene! I think this film will cause a person to reflect on who they would actually be if really hard, impossible things, seemingly out of your control showed up randomly. Desperation causes people to make crazy decisions. Also, I think it's one of those films that could really cause a person to look in the mirror and ask themselves, \"what am I really made of?\" You can be a victim or a victor, but you can't be both. The Shift film name is perfect for the film. We can let the world shift us or we can decide to be believe in something bigger than ourselves. It's cool, slightly sci-fi, but ultimately it's kind of a wake up call to look at what's really important? The way they take you through the narrative is so unique, but a pleasant and intriguing surprise."

It is a character study of our leading man Kevin Garner as he is tested by God to see if he will still have faith in him even if he's put through hell.Kristoffer Polaha does a pretty good job giving us a lead we can understand and feel for as he is basically on the brink of death everyday with only the thought of getting back to his wife keeping him going.Neal McDonough, as I predicted, chews up every scene he's in as The Benefactor and provides us with a villain that the audience can easily hate.To balance the serious story, Heasley gives us the characters of Gabriel and Russo (played by Sean Astin and John Billingsley respectively) as the comedic reliefs. I always got a chuckle when they were on screen.The idea of Satan using multiversal tech to cause conflict and chaos across the universe is so unique to me because I truly believe Satan would do something like that.There's so many small details that I love with my personal favorite being the changing of aspect ratios to tell you which universe Kevin is currently in.Brock Heasley's directorial debut doesn't overstay its welcome and leaves audiences with a memorable and groundbreaking achievement in Christian filmmaking.Angel Studios continues to lead the way of creative filmmaking as Hollywood continues to slowly kill itself with remakes and reboots.

The arrival of new psychologist \"Rebecca\" (Anne Hathaway) injects a little life into her dull routine. This assertive sophisticate takes an interest in \"Eileen\", they go for a drink - there's even some flirting - before \"Rebecca\" shares a secret with her new friend that involves a young man in prison accused of the brutal murder of his father, and of just what his mother might know of the crime and it's causes. The first hour is quite intriguing but that sense of anticipation is let down by a last half hour that is really quite undercooked and the denouement, well that is just incomplete - on just about every level.

                    "content": "At first, I'd want to say the film Eileen 'Carol by way of Jim Thompson,' and all this while being based on a whole other book (unread by me). But that makes it sound both more emotionally restrained and/or romantic and even more unpleasant than this is or could even pretend to be. And there is a nasty streak running through this that means you can't much \"like\" anyone or \"relate\" and that is, in its way in 2023 cinema, refreshing. Needless to say, it's my kind of thoroughly engrossing, perverse, precisely character-based and subjectively presented study Neo-Noir, where circumstance and chance meets the fatalism of a child of a cop, and yet...I didn't think it was tonally all over the place as I've seen a few of the reactions, as it is all of a piece as we are seeing things from this young woman's jaundiced and outsider-y perspective. On that level, for as unpleasant as things get for Eileen (and as unpleasant as she makes things eventually), it is all about a woman - a human being, but especially as a woman - who has so little prospects or hope for much in the way of change for herself, and the one new beacon of light is quite up front about what she gets out of people (and that is... pretty one sided!)And if you need a connecting thread, going back to this as a Feminist story (or an anti-Feminist one if that is your reading), one could say Eileen is about a woman realizing who she is, what is her agency (and the full dearth of it), why she needs to break free, and this despite everything in her life being crap. As is the case with countless Film Noirs and Femme Fatales, sometimes it takes that one New Wild Card Connection (ie Stanwyck in Double Indemnity) to shake things up and change things; Rebecca hearkens back to so many of the cunning and sultry blond women of yore, only this time the \"Average Joe\" archetype is a mousy young lady who is at a muddy crossroads with a Very Bad Dad (though he's not the only one, as it turns out eventually.... mild spoiler).The film is brown and gray and smokey-looking, locations highlighting snow snd Christmas time can still look decrepid, but you dont feel totally despairing watching even as Eileen the character may be at points (that shot of her in the bathtub, my goodness). Eileen the film is, like Carol, beautifully shot despite/because it has such a moribund and brooding color palette and vibe. And McKenzie and a career-best Hathaway have electric chemistry (which, as it turns out, is all part of the Hathaway-Rebecca character's entire persona to act like she has this chemistry with anyone as a perpetual user), while Shea Wigham and Marin Ireland appear in bursts in this like these little tornados that pick you up and thrash you around with what they unleash on the audience.The ending is... hmm. Gotta sleep a little more of that one. Or... maybe not. Maybe that does make sense on a story level, and I wanted one more McKenzie and Hathaway scene (McKenzie by the way gets a much more unnerving and difficult person to portray, totally f-ed up and horny and confused and full of potential for violence, and it's nice to see her with someone meaty after Last Night in Soho didn't give her as much). But Eileen hits the spot if you're hankering for an (eventually) suspenseful story of moral decay and the things that make life worth living - like watching the partner you have a crush on punching a man for coming on so strong and then going back to dance without a care in the world."

This movie strides through the genres: from lesbian romance akin to Carol to Classic Noir to Horror, even a touch of Hitchcock with a soupcon of Black Comedy. Massachusetts, early 1960s Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) is a young secretary in a juvenile prison, she's lonely, dreams of love with one of the young guards, is fascinated by an inmate Lee Polk who killed his father, the Polk family are central to the unfolding of the narrative. Eileen looks after her alcoholic ex-cop father, he's verbally abusive but some of this might be designed to drive hr away to her away, to find a life of her own. A new prison Psychologist, Rebecca (Anne Hathaway) arrives and sweeps Eileen off her feet, takes her drinking and dancing, then involves her on a strange and dangerous situation. There is a plot twist at this point that cannot be revealed here without giving too much of the storey line away. The Classic Noir tinged with Horror takes over at this point, Eileen reveals her own hidden depths of depravity. Matching or even outclassing Rebecca. Her fantasy life has always been quite violent and some of this may have have bled through to influence her real life actions. Great performances from McKenzie. Hathaway and Marin Ireland as Rita Polk, Lee's mother. Directed by William Oldroyd with a screenplay by by Ottessa Moshfegh and Luke Goebel. 8/10."

                    "content": "\"Eileen\" focuses on the titular lead character (Thomasin McKenzie), a young woman in 1960s Massachusetts. Her life is less than ideal: she is sexually repressed, professionally stifled in her job as an administrative worker in a young men's prison, and has to deal with her widowed and neurotic alcoholic father (Shea Whigham) at home. Eileen's downbeat existence is upheaved, however, by the arrival of Rebecca (Anne Hathaway), a glamorous and charismatic psychiatrist who is hired at the prison. The two women's encounters with one another eventually lead down a dark path.Based on the novel of the same name by Ottessa Moshfegh (who co-wrote the screenplay), \"Eileen\" is immediately striking simply on a visual level, as every frame of it is steeped in atmosphere. The film is bathed in a wave of rusty sepias and cool blues, the only real color popping up in the form of Christmas lights or Thomasin Mackenzie's bright red lipstick. The time period and place in which it is set (1960s New England) is also demonstrated impeccably. This works greatly to the film's advantage, given that its narrative arc is quite sparsely drawn (and I don't mean that as a demerit)--simply that the story is lean and succinct.The first two acts largely work to establish Eileen's loneliness and depressing interpersonal dynamics with her father, with Hathaway's character jutting in and unknowingly shaking up Eileen's humdrum routine. It is at times difficult to discern where the story is exactly going; there are hints of a budding lesbian love affair, though the character perspectives and their foggy motives more or less put the brakes on this avenue (at least for one of them). There is a dark twist in the last act that feels somewhat arbitrary, though it functions in terms of driving the timid Eileen to take drastic actions for once in her life (for better or for worse). If nothing else, the climax of the film is disturbing.While I feel that the film comes across as slightly irresolute in terms of character motives and their relationship to the events that transpire in the climax, what makes it all ultimately work is the well-written dialogue paired with McKenzie and Hathaway's performances. McKenzie excels in her portrayal of the emotionally downtrodden protagonist, while Hathaway goes full-throttle (bordering on camp) as the Harvard-educated, freewheeling Rebecca, a woman with her own unnamed demons. Shea Whigham also gives a memorable performance as Eileen's alcoholic ex-cop father.While I think the screenplay leaves behind a few loose ends in the wake of arbitrary events and decisions, I suppose it is also worth noting that these loose ends, arbitrary events, and decisions are also sometimes demonstrative of life itself. The film effectively depicts just how the chemistry between two humans can quickly spiral into a grim and dangerous place, with neither party foreseeing it. The fact that it is visually stunning and robustly acted make it worth viewing. 8/10."

We get no Act 3 and no resolution to what went on in the whole film. Every single plot point was left open with too much room left to interpretation.

Shea is a retired cop and sits around the house a lot, just drinking and swinging his service revolver around in the air-I guess to remind everyone that he used to be a cop. Jefferson plays the cop that keeps answering the call when Shea gets his gun out. Anne plays the new psychiatrist at the center and becomes friends with Thomasin.

Then, like I said, it gets weird at the end and leaves unanswered questions.It's rated R for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour 7 37 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD or stream. If I were you, I'd wait until it comes to cable tv."

Most movies have at least some redeeming value, and it's almost an indictment of my own flick-picking skills to give one the bare minimum. But that's where I find myself with Eileen--a mess of a film without a single coherent character or theme.For a very basic overview, Eileen tells the story of the titular character (Thomasin McKenzie), a 20-something secretary at a boys prison in 1960s New England. She hates her job, has no romantic potentials, and is also basically a care nurse for a drunkard ex-cop father (Shea Whigham). But when the prison hires new psychologist Rebecca (Anne Hathaway), Eileen finds a sort of kindred spirit or role model to give her life a little glimmer of hope--until a scenario unfolds that threatens to destroy both of them.There's no way that a film starring Hathaway, McKenzie, and even Whigham should be this devoid of entertainment or thematic relevance--yet here we are. Eileen is the epitome of \"throwing stuff at the wall and see what sticks\" filmmaking, and in this case it all slides to the floor. I did not feel compelled by a single plot element--even the curveball thrown near the film's end--and I had not an ounce of care for any single character, as their creation and unfolding were so oblique and all over the place. Not a single morsel to sink my teeth into.After listening to an interview with the writers/director and hearing them essentially say that the film can mean \"whatever you make of it\", and implying that parts may be closer to fantasy than reality, it pretty much sealed the deal for me. Perhaps if you enjoy providing every scrap of plot sensibility and character motivation yourself you'll like this far more than I, but it I am not a fan of such movie-making unless it is exquisite--and Eileen is a far cry from that."

The acting by Ann Hathaway and Thomasin McKenzie is quite simply of the highest caliber ; they nail the characters they are portraying. The locations and 'art direction' are every bit as good as qualities I reference above. You will be drawn into the movie from its beginning and you're never quite sure where it's going. The ending will disappoint many and I guess I too was disappointed at the end but to be fair the script is taken from a novel. The film is expertly executed in every phase of the filmmakers art, I don't think that can be disputed but for those that what all the loose ends tied up or a conclusive ending, they will find the film unsatisfying. I can tell you this; I would be pleased if only half the movies I go to see were as well done as 'Eileen' and I think the movie will stay with you and make you think. It was only then, after I had seen it and digested it that I fully appreciated the full quality of the film. Post Script : my partner pointed out some details in the film the subtlety of which I did not pick up on which if you get them will only make the film better in my estimation."

As they go to the bar and Eileen hopes it will be okay and it goes well. With the music and even the dancing of the two girls it is so well done that I almost had tears in my eyes. In the next third it was the boy in the prison who had killed his father and we see his mother called in by the older woman Anne Hathaway, she refuses to speak at the meeting. The third part of the film is incredible like a noir, nasty and wonderful. At the very end there is something else that is strange but happy, maybe. Moving and difficult, but a very good film."

Eileen lives with her dad, a retired cop who is an alcoholic and emotionally abusive of Eileen. Then just in time before Christmas, the corrections facility introduces the new resident psychologist, a splashy dame from Harvard named Rebecca... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the screen adaptation of the novel of the same name, which I have not read and hence I cannot comment how closely the movie stick to the book. The best aspects of the film are the two leading performances: Thomasin McKenzie (as Eileen) and Anne Hathaway (as Rebecca) are solid, period. Alas, it's not their faut that the script leaves them shorthanded for a good part on the movie. Indeed the Big Reveal doesn't come until just over an hour into the movie, and hence the \"crime drama\" part gets only the last half hour. Id this a \"bad\" movie? It is not. But neither is it great or a \"near classic\" as another reviewer here puts it. For that the movie lacks the necessary punch.\"Eileen\" is currently playing in US theaters. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (only 3 people including myself). Even though \"Eileen\" is currently rated 85% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, I can't see this playing much longer in the theater. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you are in the mood for an ok, but just ok, psychological crime drama, check it out and draw your own conclusion."

Yeah I have no idea either) and is apparently based on a 2015 book of the same name which I haven't read as to be honest I only saw a trailer for the film about a week ago. Set in 1960s Massachusetts the story is set around the titular (any excuse to use that word) character played by Thomasin McKenzie. Eileen works at an all boys prison as is a bit set in the ways of her everyday routine. She goes to work and then she comes home only to have to continue working basically as a carere for her alcholic dad played by Shea Whigham (no relationship to the police officer in the Simpsons although he was good in Boardwalk Empire). Eileen's life is changed when one day when the prison brings in a new physiologist called Rebecca played by Anne Hathaway who let's just say doesn't play by the rules.As I mentioned earlier I only saw a trailer for this film about a week a go otherwise I wouldn't have known about it (good job marketing). The trailer was very vague and for this type of film it needed to be and so what it was mainly the cast that had me intrigued about this one. Thomasin McKenzie you might remember was the lead in Edgar Wrights Last Night in Soho, a film in which she shown in for me. I was surprised to not have seen her in more things since then but I'm happy to say she's back on fine form here. She's playing a character that needed to be played with subtly. A character that is learning about herself and developing slowly as the film moves on and Thomasin does a great job of getting those emotions across. She even outshone Anne Hathaway for me which is some feat considering she puts in a solid performance in this film too.As for the story itself, it's very much a slow burn focused around self discovery and watching a young woman start to find herself in the world. It's really not for everyone and I did feel that despite its runtime being just shy of 100 minuets it didn't always use that time as well as it could have. I particularly found the ending to be a bit disappointing especially after a film that up until that point does a good job of keeping the tension and keeping the audience guessing as to where the film is going next. If you enjoy good acting and don't mind a slow burn thriller then this one's for you but I do feel this one's going to have quite a niche target audience and may struggle at the box office."

Basically, set in Boston, Massachusetts in the 1960s, Eileen Dunlop (Thomasin McKenzie) is a young woman who lives a dull existence working in a youth detention/correctional facility (young offenders prison) for teenage boys. At work, Eileen is given the cold shoulder by Mrs. Murray (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) and her colleagues. She has been watching one of the inmates, Lee Polk (Sam Nivola, Alessandro's son), for some time and may be having fantasies about him. Eileen's home life is worse however, living with her widowed and alcoholic father, Jim (Shea Whigham), a former police chief who suffers from paranoia and is emotionally abusive towards his daughter. Eileen frequently daydreams about killing herself and her father. Her world is turned upside down by the arrival of a new psychologist, Rebecca Saint John (Anne Hathaway), who joins the prison staff. Eileen is immediately drawn to Rebecca's intellectual conversation and glamorous appearance. After Eileen has been talking about him, Rebecca begins working with Lee Polk, who is revealed to have stabbed his father to death and has been imprisoned since. Rebecca invites Lee's mother, Rita (Marin Ireland), to speak with her and her son, but Rita soon leaves distraught after Lee refused to speak with her. Rebecca invites Eileen to join her that evening at a local bar. Rebecca introduces Eileen to smoking, and they spend the night drinking and dancing. Rebecca kisses Eileen before leaving which excites her. The next morning, Eileen wakes up lying in her own vomit in her car and finds that Jim locked her out of the house. While cleaning the car, a local policeman visits to tell her that the neighbours have complained about Jim's violent and erratic behaviour. Consequently, Jim must relinquish his gun and give it to Eileen. At work, Eileen is upset to find out that Rebecca has already left for the Christmas holiday. Eileen spends the day sleeping on Rebecca's desk. Eileen receives a call from Rebecca on Christmas Eve, inviting her for drinks at her house. Eileen is delighted and they have a drink when she arrives. But Rebecca is panicked and eventually reveals that they are actually in the Polks' house. Rebecca arrived at the house earlier to question Rita about Lee, suspecting he was sexually abused by his father. But their conversation became heated, they got into a scuffle, and it ended with Rita falling into the basement. While Rita was unconscious, Rebecca tied her up and drugged her. Rebecca intends to coerce Rita into admitting involvement in her son's abuse and wants Eileen as her witness. Eileen reluctantly agrees to help, getting her father's gun from her car. In the basement, Rita initially refuses to answer Rebecca's questions, until Eileen threatens to shoot her. With the gun's safety off, Rita breaks down and admits that, although initially ignorant of her husband's abuse of Lee, she eventually became aware after walking in on her husband in Lee's room. She felt powerless to stop the abuse and enjoyed her husband's renewed interest in her, so it continued, she gave Lee an enema and bathed him before he went to bed. As Rita finishes her story, Eileen (perhaps accidentally) shoots her in the shoulder. As she yells in pain, Eileen and Rebecca drug Rita into unconsciousness. As Rebecca panics, Eileen suggests that they frame Jim for Rita's shooting and run away together. Eileen finally admits she has feelings and is in love with Rebecca. They carry Rita and put her into Eileen's car boot and agree to meet at Eileen's house. Arriving there, Eileen waits and looks out the window waiting for Rebecca, while her father is sleeping in his chair. After Rebecca fails to show up and dawn breaks, Eileen drives to a remote forest. She leaves the still-drugged Rita in her car and turns on the engine to asphyxiate her smoke. Before leaving, Eileen's father briefly woke up and she wished him goodnight. Eileen returned to the main road and hitches a ride, smiling to herself as she leaves the town; the fate of Rebecca is unknown. Also starring Owen Teague as Randy, Jefferson White as Buck Warren, and Tonye Patano as Mrs. Stevens. McKenzie gives a good performance as the young prison worker with strange thoughts, but Hathaway almost steals the show looking hot and being mysterious, they are an intriguing double act, I kind of hoped Whigham was on a bit more. It is a fairly simplistic story with good period detail, a near-lesbian relationship that is toxic and takes a dark turn much later is interesting, but it doesn't go quite the way I hoped or expected, it could have been more thrilling or racy, and I must say that the ending was a bit of a let-down, overall it is intriguing enough, a reasonable psychological drama. Worth watching, in my opinion!"

                    "content": "EILEEN is a slow-burn of a movie, for sure, but it's fascinating nonetheless and rewards the patient viewer with a completely unexpected (but perfectly legitimate) twist in its final third. Very thoughtful attention to period detail (mid-60s, small-town Massachusetts), outstanding mood and mostly careful pacing contribute to the success of the film, but it is the never-less-than-gripping performance of Thomasin McKenzie (LEAVE NO TRACE) and the slightly unhinged work from Anne Hathaway that make this a film well worth the viewer's time.Eileen (McKenzie) is a young lady who returns home to her small town from college when her mother falls ill. As the movie begins, her mother had died and her father, the former police chief of the town, hangs around the house all day, drinking gin and does little other than berate his daughter and occasionally brandish a gun in the neighborhood, yelling at kids. Eileen has a secretarial job at the local boys prison, and spends much of her day gazing at the young men around her (both inmates and staff) and indulging in various fantasies, some involving sex and others involving violence. She is ostensibly her father's care-taker, but other than buying him booze, she doesn't do anything to keep house or to encourage her dad or herself to move forward. She is stuck. Other than her fantasies, it's hard to see that she has an ambition, drive or future.Enter the new prison psychologist, Rebecca (Hathaway), a Harvard grad full of modern ideas. She's been dropped right into a boys and men's club of an institution, where it's clear her new ideas and unconventional approach to work and life will likely just run her into a brick wall of resistance. If the prison is a square hole, she is certainly a round peg. But she's also the electricity that ignites Eileen. Her passions, her interests, her very appearance are transformed when Rebecca shows an interest in her.Eileen is clearly vulnerable to such an outside influence, and it's pretty clear that Rebecca is exploiting this...somehow. We're never quite sure where this relationship might be going, emotionally or physically. But when it reaches a turning point, it's a crazy ride for the viewers. The surprise of the film is delivered in such a matter-of-fact way that we are both shocked and nod our heads in acknowledgment. We didn't see it coming but it makes perfect sense, given what we've seen of these characters.No further plot points will be revealed, but suffice it to say that the final 15 - 20 minutes or so of this film are filled with incredible tension and leave your mind reeling with all the possibilities and potential consequences. Director William Oldroyd (his second film after the even more compelling LADY MACBETH) juggles what is really a lurid genre piece into a gripping character study. We watch Eileen's growth and actions with grim fascination. McKenzie is just terrific in this film and Hathaway chews the scenery to just the right degree. And Marin Ireland makes a great impression in a small but pivotal role.It's not a perfect film. Shea Wigham is fine as Eileen's father, but the role is very one-dimensional. We aren't given a chance to see that man that once was. The other very minor characters in the film are also one-dimensional too. And certainly, even at 96 minutes, one feels the film slackening its pace once or twice. I'm okay with a slow burn, but there are a few minutes of the film where nothing really seems to happen. I'd guess it could have ultimately come in at 91 minutes and not missed a beat. But these are pretty minor quibbles. It was a lot of fun, in the end."

                    "content": "\"I'm just kind of average, I think.\" While this effervescently delivered line encapsulates the essence of Eileen, her film is quite the opposite: It's above average in every way. The follow-up to director William Oldroyd's smash hit \"Lady Macbeth\" that proves that writer Ottessa Moshfegh's talents are just as striking on screen as on the page, this intense, deliberate, disorienting period piece chronicles the inner turmoil of its titular antiheroine with the élan of an astonishingly ferocious storyteller.24-year-old Eileen Dunlop (Thomasin McKenzie) is an enigma. She's timid, mousy, and without even the most basic of frills; however, she's also apprehensive, repressed, and harboring shocking fantasies. She has perpetuated a feedback loop of self-loathing and self-consciousness, and discerns little purpose in her life in a scroungy 1960s town besides her dead-end jobs as secretary of a juvenile prison for boys and carer for her alcoholic father Jim (Shea Whigham). But in the days prefacing Christmas, her world, not at all au fait with style or class, turns on its head when Dr. Rebecca Saint John (Anne Hathaway), steeped in haute couture and a glamorous je ne sais quoi that follows her wherever she goes, arrives for her new position at the prison. Eileen is instantly enchanted and resolves to win Rebecca's favor, materializing a latent Oedipal complex with a maternal Rebecca and an abusive Jim. Immediately and unceasingly, the film's acting and cast dynamics are flawless. McKenzie is a revelation as the lead, imbibing even the tiniest of tics and mannerisms into Eileen's portrayal, proffering audiences one of the most absorbing and stimulatingly layered characters in recent memory. And of course, the incomparable Anne Hathaway never disappoints, mimicking her real-life celebrity glamour while adding a peppermint-fresh bite that's so crisp it breaks your teeth.Of course, the third-act twist, faithful to the source material's ending, was the most polarizing aspect of the movie, a tonal and narrative volte-face that veers a \"Carol\"-esque psychodrama into thriller territory. But the ending of \"Eileen\" doesn't skip a beat, at no times feeling undeserved or out of left field, instead gliding into what may be the most macabre, haunting, repugnant monologue ever captured on screen, then immediately whisking us into a gleefully frantic crescendo that sees Eileen's character arc come full circle. However, some of Eileen's fantasies of leaving located in the book have been lost in translation, making the ending a little more ambiguous than it should've been.Ari Wegner's cinematography is impossible to ignore. From the camerawork itself (the aspect ratio and film grain deserve a chef's kiss) to the set pieces and period atmosphere, the film embodies that time of transition and degradation in a downtrodden New England to perfection. And in combination with a score that knows exactly what it's doing and wardrobe design that tells a story of its own, the movie's on- and off-camera decisions accumulate to a precise, calibrated end result. Forgiving the book's narrative details that would've made the finale much more satiating, it's hard not to get hooked on \"Eileen.\""

She does so Little(For the Most Part) in her Emoting and she's so Dialed Down(within this Film Performance), and Yet is So Effective. On top of that \"You have a Plain Face\" as Rebecca puts it. And Honestly, in her Case Specifically, that Plainness works in her Favour in multiple Aspects. Another thing also, she totally sells that she was in Love with Rebecca. 😍💛 Anne Hathaway, what more can I say. Just so Skilled in Acting Ability and Line Delivery. She plays this Shady, Sure of Herself, Sexy character named Rebecca, who Eileen is in Love With.💚 Marin Ireland, Super Strong Performance in my Opinion, she's not In the film for long but that segment near the end that she gets was Shocking as Hell and the Stakes were also Strong because of This.🍻 Shea Whigham, he plays the Drunk Dad, and I really like the scenes with his character and Eileen just talking. Good acting and Strong Performance from him.2. 🎵 The Score was really good and effective in multiple Scenes.3a. 📜💬 The Screenplay, I loved some of the moments of \"outta nowhere\" gunshots happening to either themselves or other people, because of the Auditorium Being so loud, anytime it was a long prolonged quiet scene, I was just waiting on edge 😆, but it only happens 3 times. Also, all of the Dialogue was Strong, many scenes are just people talking but it was delivered well and was interesting, when you have scenes that are just people talking yet keep people engaged (me anyway), you've won half the battle.3b. 📈The Plotline, I won't give away the Plotline but let's just say, things take a turn for the worst.4. 🎥 The Cinematography and Edits were Solid.And here's my 1 Major Gripe with the Film -1. 😔 Why that Very ending? Look, I haven't read the Book but even if the book ends like that, you CANNOT end the film like that. They needed to rewrite just that Very Ending, everything up until Eileen hitches a Ride Works. Just go back a bit and do something with that \"situation\" that Eileen and Rebecca were in.When the film ended, I could feel that the audience were bewildered when it ended, and everyone just got up slowly like \"that's it?\" 🤷Overall, a Great watch, a Slow Build with Outstanding Performances but that Very ending just brings the film down so much (for me)."

                    "content": "William Oldroyd attempts the change of tone in this film - its big twist - with all the finesse of a DJ with one turntable mixing two tunes together. And Oldroyd isn't a very good DJ to start with. When that fails, all he can think to do is turn the volume up on the score. All the problems with this film lead back to Oldroyd.As readers of the novel will know, Otessa Moshfegh (who oddly gets half the screenwriting adaptation credit here, as if she had little familiarity with her own novel and how it works, and doesn't work) filled her pages with absolute grime, leaving the reader to imagine hair-filled carpets, drains, basins, counters, etc. Her anti-heroine never shaves her legs, much less her pubic area. Just about every setting in the novel is a public health crisis while Oldroyd's film has exactly one pubic hair. In a bar of soap. This is a problem.\"X-ville,\" as the New England town that is the setting of the novel Eileen is called, is the kind of place even the reader doesn't want to spend time in, a place where understandably no one begrudges the titular character for getting out of - so much so, no one even ever comes looking for her after her departure (even though her abandoned vehicle would've led the authorities right to her, a lapse in logic we're perhaps meant to believe is symptomatic of the inertia engulfing the place). Moshfegh is hardly working for the X-ville tourism board. This is all spelled out in the opening chapter of the novel, since Eileen is narrated in retrospect by the title character later in her life. This is another problem with Oldroyd's film since the adaptation only deals with the immediacy of these events and thus the duality of the novel - and all of its context and point of view - is lost. Eileen is not a perfect work or even a masterpiece of modern literature, not by a long stretch; its strength lies in its narrator's voice which nobody here, including the author herself, seems to understand.Casting, pretty much all the way around, is a major problem. Though Oldroyd's cast is expert in their approach to what they've been given, they are all largely miscast. The casting of Thomasin McKenzie in the title role is particularly blunderous. She's a wonderful actress and acquits herself nicely here but she's so miscast the most she could ever hope to be is a paper-doll construction of the actual character, a character who should be greasy and unkempt, who is probably pasty and smells a bit off - you will need reminding that Eileen Dunlap is a WORLD-CLASS MISANTHROPIC SELF-LOATHER, along the lines of Ignatius J. Reilly, who doesn't shave her legs, her underarms, who is scatalogically obsessed to the point of timing out and controlling her massive bowel movements which are one of her life's few pleasures and often has an itchy bottom. I'm thinking Janeane Garofalo, in her '90s prime, might've turned heads taking on an assignment like this. But not here. McKenzie's casting would make more sense if she were revealed to be an imposter who tied up the real Eileen Dunlop and locked her in a closet. She tries. But with her perfect complexion, perfectly brushed hair, and soft willowy high pitched voice, it's amazing she suggests any internalisation of the character at all - and given there's no voiceover, the entirety of the character, who is given full uninterrupted flow in the novel, is required to be fully internalised here. It's like watching a poorly cast high school production of Eileen. McKenzie isn't helped at all by the filmmakers' decision to rob her of Eileen Dunlop's primary objective - escape, to get out of X-ville at any cost - until the film's final minute. It doesn't even qualify as an after thought since it appears they never gave it any thought at all. Instead this is substituted with minor fantasies of Eileen's, a few moments here and there, the likes of which used to be popular on certain prestige television shows about 20 years ago. Even these are poorly staged and perplexingly lacking in tone - are they supposed to be funny? Empathetic? Who knows. More likely, they're just meant to jolt the audience out of their stupor.The much vaunted performance from Anne Hathaway as Rebecca St. John proves to be little more than a fashion story. She is similarly miscast though likely her casting is the only reason the film exists at all. She's too old for this role - which is accentuated because McKenzie reads too young for hers. Eileen and Rebecca should nearly be contemporaries. (It's telling that Rebecca is never described as a \"Dr.\" in the novel, a title she is granted here to account for Hathaway's obvious gravitas.) Instead, what little chemistry the two have reads more like a mother/daughter dynamic, with Rebecca filling the void of Eileen's dead mother. Superficial comparisons to Todd Haynes' Carol are insulting to that work. This isn't Carol. If anything, it leans in the direction of Heavenly Creatures, that is, if it were anything at all.In the novel, it's not quite clear whether Rebecca sees herself as a movie star (she's a redhead there, not platinum blonde as in the film) or, more likely, perceived as such by Eileen within the context of X-ville. Rebecca's actions certainly suggest she is a woman of serious concerns, albeit one who sees herself as towering over the plebs of X-ville; she entitles herself to be judge, jury and the law. One thing's for sure: casting a movie star as Rebecca robs her of any complexity or mystique she might of otherwise had, if she were an actual character instead of the bungle of poses and attitudes Hathaway strikes here. In the context of the film's mixed reception and spotty release, Hathaway is obviously both a blessing and a curse but she's slumming it here, imagining herself in some other movie. Oldroyd hones right in on her too, never realising that if the character is to exist at all on celluloid, she needs distance, as she is after all, a fleeting distant memory of the protagonist, who has probably been greatly embellished in Eileen's twisted, razor sharp mind, especially to account for her collusion with her. While the rest of Oldroyd's film is immediate, Hathaway's performance plays like a well-polished memory that likely never existed at all. Here she is one note and when the needle gets to the end of the record she is over without even a fade. Hathaway's performance is all chorus with no verses. She must've been enticed by the wig.Similarly, when the characters of Eileen's father and Mrs. Polk illicit our sympathy, you know the casting is way off base. Shea Wigham as the former is a terrific actor and he suggests a full character here - I like the movie he's in - but he's no Mr. Dunlop, who should be absolutely repulsive. Here he doesn't have a hair out of place - it's like Tom Ford styled him - and at worst suggests a broken down Andrew Scott, which would still be better than most. He's not quite lovable but seems a reasonable man, nothing like the lecherous, vile, abusive drunk of the novel. (He's supposed to be a hardened, psychotic former police chief suffering from ultra paranoid delusions, like \"who are all these other people in the house\"-type delusions.) A doctor states that he'll die if he doesn't stop drinking and suffer the same fate if he does but Wigham doesn't seem that pickled at all and appears to put on a clean shirt every day; nothing like the yellowed, sweat stained, stretched out wife beaters of the novel with the smell of hard liquor rising from his every pore, and probably urine and faeces as well. (In the novel, he's beyond caring if his daughter sees him doing his business on the toilet.) Wigham seems like his life would be greatly improved if someone would just invent a television remote 20 years earlier.Marin Ireland is, of course, a terrific actress and she does her job here - with a much truncated speech that has been so shredded in this adaptation viewers who haven't read the novel will likely need a special decoder ring to figure out what she's talking about. Which begs the question: who did the filmmakers make this film for? Are they embarrassed by the content of the novel? Do they think diluting it in this way - and arguably robbing it of its power - somehow makes it more...commercial? Mrs. Polk needs to be more a of beast, and for all that she gives, the slim and pretty Ireland only confounds matters further. At a point when the entire film is spinning out of Oldroyd's control, and Eileen is at its blackest, he fills the screen with the faces of his pretty female leads and the entire premise couldn't seem more contrived or poorly staged. You half expect someone on screen to just say \"Scene\" and roll credits.What remains on screen is so deflated and half-hearted the mere minutes that follow hardly matter, which seems to be the consensus of the filmmakers who appear to have spent more time commissioning custom \"period\" style graphics for their producing partners than figuring out how to adapt this troublesome, unyielding, almost stubborn novel to the screen.Ultimately, Oldroyd's limiting sense of taste and, dare I say it, surprisingly middle class sensibility, does not extend itself to the vomitous, bilious \"haven't brushed my teeth in three days\" taste where Moshfegh's novel idles and without that, as a starting point, it just doesn't work. We're meant to be lulled into a sense that the gruesome, pointless mundanity of young Eileen Dunlop's life can't possibly get any worse - and then it does. The third act isn't meant to be a jarring, half-hearted, confused tonal shift. It's meant to credibly emerge from what is already there, from what has been there all along: the grotesque. Oldroyd's folly seems to be in thinking he could make a tasteful version of Eileen, which is a bit like a bloodless version of Jaws. Only worse."

                    "content": "'Eileen' is a strange film. It raises a good many questions but answers very few. It is as though director William Ondroyd purposely made no attempt to bring resolution. Rather he's left it up to us - the viewers - to decide what was going on, and what, in the future, will happen to the film's characters.I give nothing away when I say that the film takes a turn about midway through. It is a turn the viewer could not possibly have seen coming. Many will feel betrayed by this turn as it, indeed, comes 'out of nowhere'. Others may be thrilled by the plot-turn; what seemed a rather run-of-the-mill tale of sexual awakening now and suddenly is dealing with an altogether different issue. Me? Count me among the thrilled.Eileen as played by Thomasin McKenzie works as a clerk in a local penitentiary. There she meets the institution's new psychologlist, Rebecca, played by Anne Hathaway. Sparks fly for Eileen, indeed we have love at first sight. And Rebecca seems more than willing to accommodate the young employee. And for Young Eileen a doorway to her future has opened, a way out of a life of serving her abusive alcoholic father (an always great Shea Wingham). But it is here, and now, that the film's sudden dramatic turn takes place.Eileen is based on a short story by Ottessa Mochfegh. And like many short stories the ending leaves a good deal unanswered. Which, if that is OK with you, will enhance your enjoyment. You will leave the theatre still engrossed with those characters and what the film might have been saying about them.But - and this is important - if a neatly tied-up finale makes for a story-of-choice, I'd keep my distance."

                    "content": "Halfway into Eileen and I was so intrigued by Rebecca, certain she's hiding some secrets about herself. By the end of the film something so big has come along that you're not thinking about what Rebecca's secrets are any more as the situation has turned to something much more urgent.The shock of the twist was certainly out of left field and gives the viewer a very effective, if unpalatable, jolt; however after the credits roll you feel tricked that the film gets you intrigued about Rebecca and then doesn't give any answers about her aside from the fact she's clearly able to get herself into quite a (justified imo) pickle.Unfortunately the 3rd act feels rushed... Rebecca disappears, which would be fine if the film gave this disappearance and its effect on Eileen any time to breathe. Instead Eileen is surprisingly chill about the whole situation, she instantly comes up with another plan (was it meant to look like carbon monoxide suicide? When she's clearly been shot in the shoulder? The car will be traced directly back to her surely)I was left bemused about what she was happy about in the truck at the end, after everything she's just been through there really is nothing to be smiling about. I guess they wanted it to feel like a happy ending even though it really wasn't?I'm giving this 6 purely because the performances were brilliant which elevate it from being a 5."
