(Flash Review)Cars 2 switches tracks a bit from being based in a small town to world-wide jet setter and oddly Mater seems to take center stage in this film. This film plays out like a Bond film and Mater sort of like the Pink Panther (if I understand that character correctly) as someone who inadvertently gets in the way of criminals and their plans and sort of helps the secret agents along the way, while McQueen competes in worldwide races. As an automobile and racing fan, I loved this film as there were a plethora of fun, foreign and classic cars all mixed in along the way and the races mixed NASCAR, Formula 1, Rally, and other endurance sports cars; pretty neat. From a parent of a small child perspective, it was a little advanced for kids as there was a theme of big oil vs alternative fuels and a lot more guns and peril for a G Rated movie and from the first Cars. Overall, it was fun and exciting and amusing humor of Mater the rural bloke vs international high scale people.

I am one of the few that actually had more fun with this sequel than the first one. Sure, it has elements that has been done in other movies before, except it revolves around living cars. But the creativity and clever moments makes this one a entertaining ride. While the first one's protagonist was Lightning this time, the likable hillbilly truck Mater takes the spotlight. Sure, he maybe dunce but he is a likable and funny dunce. One of the premise that doesn't get old for me, is where a average or below Joe gets put in a over a top situation. And some of the characters surrounding him or her mistakenly think he or she to be some sort of a amazing hero or heroine. The dialogue is hip and fun, the comedic parts may seem a bit childish, but it's clever and I personally thought it was funny. The animation goes into another level with this one, and the detail when it comes to the environments which takes place in Radiator Springs, Japan, Paris and England. And the animation is again superb and better. Sure, it's not in depth or emotional as the other Pixar movies, but it's still a entertaining good time. I also think the transition to Mater was a good idea, because it brings out a certain amount of uniqueness. As a matter of fact this movie kinda reminded me of animated version "Tucker & Dale vs. Evil", except it's for the whole family to enjoy.7.8/10

I knew I would like this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing I found it. As a hold-out and a bit of a cranky git, I confess I am one of those who find the 3D experience an annoyance. Maybe if they someday come up with a contraption-free (no glasses) way to see it, I might like it. My cinema only had it in 3D. Drat.However, the 3D annoying gimmick aside- I was thrilled by the lush beauty of this movie. I was also gratified by the depth and meaningful quality of the story. Recounting the plot here would not accomplish anything, so I'll skip it. Let us say that if the outcomes of all the plot points were probably predictable, that's OK--- As a "comedy" that is the formula- and it was well served.I was entranced throughout.Emily Mortimer's solid feminine sweetness and likability came through- and Michael Cain was a hoot. And the skillful comedic actor Eddie Izzard's characterisation was also true to his particular form. The cast from the first Cars film all seemed to be here as well- to good effect.I will note that this did not seem like a film made for small children at all. My auditorium was filled with the little guys- a cute and amiable crew, to be sure. But I cannot imagine that they would find the characters and the intricate story intelligible. And the jaw-droppingly beautiful scenery and artwork would also likely be lost on them.I loved this movie!

I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no "Finding Nemo" or "Toy Story." But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING.

This is not the worst movie ever made, contrary to popular belief. It's honestly pretty entertaining.

It is true that this film is not like others Pixar films.But it is not acctualy so bad.Many review-writers is telling that this film is huge disappointment,and I think it is not true.I think that expectations was too big.So,this is story about cars.About one friendship.They are completely different,but they are best friends.There is lot of nice,simple humor in the story.The scenario is "smooth" and it is easy watchable.There are much of action,surprises,cool techniques,like in James Bond. Yes,we could not expect that,but it is really OK .The characters are in many different places and they are meeting a different people.Characters are 3D,they have feelings and we feel empathy about them.But,there is a "dark side" of film,which is not like Pixar.Enemies,propaganda and that stuff.These problems confuses and my 10 year old brother.It is not ugly or violent,it is just confusing to kids.About animation,I will not discuss.It is still Pixar;great animations and visuals and everything about it.This is family film and it is really relaxing and enjoyable.Maybe sometimes is confusing,but it is not acctualy so bad.Because of action and messages that film gives: 7/10

I'm so disappointed this got snubbed at all the award ceremonies in 2012. Best animated film of all time.
---------
Cars 2 was great movie from 2011 along with Winnie The Pooh in my opinion i understand why people hate it,it's because Tow Mater became a superficial character in the film guys i like Tow Mater but only in 1st and 3rd movie, he always helped Mcqueen come on this movie needs positive reviews rather than hate.

We all know that Pixar makes incredible movies, I personally have never disliked a Pixar film. The first "Cars" film, was a great movie, not a perfect film. It was one of the least better films, Pixar has made, but that's like saying, Insomnia was one of Christopher Nolan's worst films. I had high expectations when coming to see the film, like I always have before I see a Pixar film.After my viewing of the film, I have to say Pixar never fails to produce a great, entertaining film. Although it doesn't reach the heights of Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc. It still stands by itself pretty high up there. The animation is extremely well done, the look of the film is amazing. The voice actors are great, I miss Paul Newman though. Although the film is not perfect. The movie is not perfect though, the story is not great, but not bad, the movie does not have the emotional as other Pixar films, but it is definitely not a heartless film. But the film is definitely entertaining and a great beginning to 2011 Summer movie season. Take your whole family to see this movie, it will probably not disappoint. It will not only satisfy kids, but also the adults, this film is for everyone. Fun for kids, but the adults can also connect with it and will have a great time watching this movie in theaters. It is quite an adventure and I will be glad to give it a second viewing.

Pixar seems immune to the problems that studios normally have with their sequels, in that Pixar's sequels don't, you know, stink. Cars 2, like the Toy Story films, captures every bit of sincerity, thrills, and pitch-perfect animation that the original did. It's a beautifully shot movie with terrific voice characterizations, including a surprisingly awesome turn by Larry the Cable Guy.In the movie, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has settled down in Radiator Springs with his girlfriend Sally Carerra (Bonnie Hunt) when he is goaded into joining a three-country race by an Italian Formula One car voiced by John Turturro (who's hilarious). Naturally, Lightning must take along his bestest best friend, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who's - shall we say - not as world wise as McQueen or the rest of his crew. Hilarity ensues.To add to the tension, all of the racers are required to use a new alternative fuel invented by eco-awesome-dude Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), but when a few cars mysteriously explode during the first leg of the race, in Tokyo, people start to wonder if the fuel is indeed safe. Of course it is - because the real culprit - as we learn right away! - is employing electromagnetic pulses to disable the vehicles in the hopes that people will blame the fuel, which will bring them back to good ol' yummy oil. But tipped off to this subterfuge is British agent Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) who, along with his new-to-the-field sidekick Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), is out to stop whoever's behind all of this - and that, my friends, is where Mater comes in.This isn't really a Lightning McQueen movie; he's more of a supporting character, as Mater is unwittingly pulled into the espionage business by the Brits, who mistake him for a fellow agent (those English are so gullible!). But because of Mater's inelegance and lack of focus, McQueen winds up losing that first race, a result for which he blames a crestfallen Mater. There's your friendship conflict, always a reliable trope in animation.The race then shifts to Milan and then London, with Tuturro's Bernoulli and Wilson's McQueen trading many a barb and insult (with Bernoulli usually winning). This allows the animators to mix in some awesome scenery from both countries, and you'll swear it's filmed rather than animated. Absolutely spell binding.The two plots, the spy angle and the brotherly friendship deal, dovetail nicely by movie's end, but not before we're honestly treated to some spectacular stunt driving (ahem) - off roofs, down parking garages, and so on. It's like parkour for cars, which most of us would call driving but the cars here probably call walking and climbing.I saw this movie not only in 3D but also in IMAX. I've said harsh things about 3D, and IMAX costs even more per movie. It's all worth it here. The colors are vibrant, and when something SHOULD leap out at you, it does, and it looks really, really good. The sound is shattering; your seat will rumble. It's a visual orgy.

16 years ago, Pixar Animation Studios released the first feature length computer animated film in history, Toy Story. What followed was an incredible run of success, an 11 film hot streak that yielded dozens of awards (including 11 Oscars), billions of dollars in box office receipts, and the admiration of audiences and critics everywhere. Year after year Pixar was a company you could rely on, and while not all the films were perfect, they all were at least of decent quality, and light years ahead of their competition from the likes of Dreamworks and Sony. So therefore it's heart-breaking to say that Pixar's hot streak has come to a crashing halt in 2011. Cars 2 is not just the weakest film in Pixar's catalogue, it is the worst high-profile animated release for some time.If there is one Pixar film that divides opinion much more than any other, it is 2006's Cars. While by no means a bad film, it just didn't hit in the same way as films like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, or The Incredibles. It did middling numbers at the box office (by Pixar standards) and currently sits with a 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the only film from the studio below 90%. For director John Lasseter (also head of Pixar), Cars is obviously a very personal film, a nostalgic story about the loss small-town American values in the face of increased modernity. If it's not a complete success, credit must be given to Lasseter for at least trying to say something meaningful, and in typical Pixar fashion the film stands out in the increasingly crowded computer animation film market for at least attempting thematic depth, and it's ability to reach audiences both young and old. Cars 2 on the other hand is completely devoid of depth and subtlety, and will more than likely annoy adults while at times being arguably inappropriate for children. Returning director Lasseter takes the worst character from the first film (in my opinion the biggest reason for Cars' failure), and structures the whole story around his infuriating exploits. Imagine George Lucas, upon seeing the negative feedback following The Phantom Menace, making all of Episode 2 about Jar-Jar Binks. That's the kind of thing we're left with in Cars 2. Compounding the story problems is the troubling amount of guns and violence in the film. To make the argument that 'it's OK because they're just cars' is inexcusable. This is still supposed to be a children's film, and while the espionage sub-plot does have potential, there are elements that seem shockingly unsuitable for young kids.This brings up a question: why would Pixar choose to revisit the only film they have produced which could conceivably be called a failure? Lasseter is on record as saying that the company would only explore sequels to their films if a good story could be developed, and the level of quality of the two Toy Story sequels seems to back up this sentiment, but it's hard to believe that anyone would think the script of Cars 2 is worthy of that high standard. Interestingly, there is one other way that Cars stands apart from other Pixar films: the estimated $8 billion merchandising revenues. While all Pixar films have profited from merchandising, none have had the global appeal of Cars. It's upsetting to think that Pixar, a company who seemed previously to place greater importance on the quality of its films than the bottom line, have gone for the easy cash grab, but there really seems to be no other reason for the existence of Cars 2. Everything about the films seems designed to increase the potential for selling merchandise, whether it's the films global locations which pander to international audiences, or the increasingly ridiculous characters and set-pieces, tailor made to be toys and video games. It's a cynical opinion, one which I had hoped I'd never feel towards a Pixar film, but it is undeniably true: Cars 2 is a film created not as an artistic endeavour, but to feed ancillary markets.Pixar's golden run had to end sometime, and one bad film is a small price to pay for 11 good, with two or three being genuine masterpieces. What is most unfortunate is the catastrophic level of Cars 2's failure, and Pixar will undoubtedly lose a lot of respect for making such a soulless film, unworthy of the studio's name.

We hoped it would never happen, but no one is perfect. Even the best can stumble. This had to happen eventually. Even the string of terrific Disney's classic films and the 90s Disney Renaissance didn't last forever. I'm afraid that, yes, Pixar has made a bad film.Cars 1 was their least ambitious film. The story was predictable and character development obvious making it their most mediocre film. It was good but it lacked that little extra touch that made their films great. However, they had some great side characters, a heart, and wonderful scenes that elevated it up beyond most other films. But ever since this film's announcement I always wondered why. McQueen had his story and there's not much else to tell. Like Finding Nemo, where else is there to go? And I'd rather see sequels to better movies like The Incredibles, even Bug's Life seems to have more potential. It's easy to see why they made a sequel to it, since all you need to do is go to Disneyland or any Disney Store and see it covered in McQueen and Mater, which happened to be two my of three year-old cousin's first words. Off all the Pixar films, Cars made the most with the merchandise.The biggest problem is the story. Cars 1, while predictable, was touching. Cars 2 has almost no heart or character development. The focus shifts from McQueen to Mater. McQueen had his story in the first and there's little to tell here. He has one character moment that's essentially the same realization as the first film's. The problem with Mater is that he's such a simple character. Everything about him is on the surface for all to see. He's the same person throughout the movie, with one predictable realization which goes no where, that he doesn't warrant his own film. He's like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove. They're both terrific side characters but lack enough complexity for a full story. And Larry the Cable Guy has always been better with the other Blue Collar guys rather than on his own.While Cars 1's highlight was its side characters, this movie almost abandons them. They do nothing. McMissile is a moving plot device and little more. Shiftwell is supposed to be a love interest but lacks any interesting moments. The rest of Radiator Springs basically sit back while McQueen and Mater have all the fun. Their stories and character are pushed aside so Larry can have fun being Mater. Because of this, there are almost no funny little side scenes where characters just have fun being themselves. Instead, most of the humor is derived from seeing Mater do silly things.The look is impressive but not more than anything else Pixar's done. With each movie, the studio has pushed the graphics into new levels. Each movie has had some wow moment where audiences can't help but be amazed by what they're seeing. There were times in Cars 1 when it looked almost real. Cars 2 lacks any wow factor. One of the most impressive sets, Tokyo, were already spoiled by the Tokyo Mater short. This more than anything makes me wonder if Pixar was even trying to up the ante or if they were just using what they had to make a movie a year.Spies and Cars seems to work well together. After all, any Bond or Bourne film will easily demonstrate why the two go together. Indeed, the opening scene on the drilling platform is easily the best with the fast chase and cool gadgets. But they weren't able to properly combine the racing and spy elements, almost as if you're watching two movies at once. There's too much spy stuff for the racing to be interesting, which becomes pointless against the overpowering and overly clichéd spy story. Perhaps Pixar should have set it as simply a spy movie set in the Cars universe and had McQueen and his friends in cameos or as a background story.Another lousy spot is the music. Cars 1 had a terrific soundtrack with excellent uses of popular songs like Life is a Highway and Route 66. But there's not one memorable song or music cue in this movie. Giacchino usually does terrific work like with The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Up. But he too fumbles the ball here. Perhaps he was just uninspired by what he had to work with.Cars is Lasseter's pet project. But I think he's too close to it. He's got that Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy problem. The people around him either were in awe of the man who made Pixar and Toy Story or they were afraid to hurt his feelings since he loves the Cars franchise so much. Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project. But with Lasseter off working more directly with Disney, he really should have had a co-director or perhaps given the reins to someone else like he did with Toy Story 3.I almost rated this movie higher. It is fun while you're watching it, even if as soon as it's over it becomes too easy to pick apart the problems. But this is Pixar. They've dominated the animation market since Toy Story and have been pushing the boundaries at the Academy Awards ever since. To see them stumble with a not-so-great film would be one thing. But they're coming off from two Best Picture nominees to a movie that's simply flashy but with little substance. Kids will love the bright colors and silly antics, but parents will hate having to then buy twelve new Mater toys. Cars 2 is stalled and in need of a tune-up.

My nine year old son liked Cars 2 a lot and me and my wife too.The special effects are really phenomenal. I was very surprised how realistic all the sceneries were built up. Congratuilations to all the staff for all these fireworks. Then the story was packed with some good spy elements à la James Bond. The fly scenes were well executed too and there was more action than in the first Car. It offers also a great tour in Europe nicest countries as in Paris, Rome, Riviera, London and in Tokio.I think this is the plan how all the coming animation movies should be made. Suspense and in the same time very near plot to the reality could like children and adults. Just take the examples Ice Age or Rio.Final vote: 9/10

The saddest thing about Pixar today is, they don't know what movie they are going to release on their 25th Anniversary since one of their upcoming projects "Newt" was cancelled despite from Blue Sky's Rio plot. Cars 2 feels like it's a direct-to-DVD film. It's not really bad but it's just unnecessary. Though, the action is pretty cool. The kids will enjoy it but the rest is like Rango. Instead of Western Themes, it's Spy movies. The story isn't bad except it doesn't give anything emotional and heartwarming unlike the other Pixar movies. Cars 2 is pretty fun but the most important ingredient of their movies is missing.Firstly, the lead of the film is Mater. The theme of the film is Espionage but it's just some sort of an animated version of a particular spy movie. Everything moves here. There are too many action that any kid can enjoy but the story is probably too interesting for grown ups. If the movie gets focused to the plot, the kids might get bored. The missing Pixar element here is the heartwarming moments. The movie still has a heart but it fails to be compelling. Don't worry about the humor, that is one thing they will never fail. Some of the writing seems rushed.The voices do what they do best. John Lasseter knows what to do in this movie. The animation is obviously pretty good. The score is a bit generic that you may hear in any movie or television show. The action keeps everything moving. Watching the car fighting scenes is like watching a kid playing his little toy cars and let them do something fun. Which is pretty impressive.In Pixar, the craftsmanship or the animation doesn't quite matter. It's all about the compelling story and the emotional heartwarming moments. It's hard to say Cars 2 is bad film. Pixar still knows how to make a good movie but without their important elements, it's like you're watching a movie from a different studio. Once again, it's pretty fun but if you expect a lot of Pixar magic then you might get disappointed.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cars 2. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of car mechanics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Mater's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cars 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Lighting McQueen's existential catchphrase "Kachow" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Pixar's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have a Lighting McQueen tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

Sometimes you go to a Pixar movie and get a deeply insightful, heart-tugging classic that sings to the deepest corners of the human condition.And sometimes you go to a Pixar movie for some uncomplicated fun and adventure."Cars 2" is unapologetically the latter; it never reaches the emotional depths of "Up" or "Toy Story 3", but it never tries to be. Instead, this is a family-friendly action-packed adventure movie, the kind of movie you watch because you just want to sit back and enjoy the spectacle. Whether it's the gorgeous scenery, the breakneck chase sequences, or Finn McMissile's never-ending arsenal of cool gadgets, "Cars 2" is a movie that simply wants you to have fun as you follow along with its whirlwind escapades.Some might feel this is a disappointment from Pixar, but I think that's being unfair -- after all, no one begrudges Steven Spielberg for producing both "Schinder's List" and "Indiana Jones"."Cars 2" isn't high art, but it never tries to be. Even the best creators deserve to cut back and have fun once in a while.

"Cars 2" is an unusual case of a highly anticipated film that was not simultaneously released here locally as in the States. I wonder why? Anyway after I watched this film, I think I know why. For all the positive goodwill that the first Cars film had, this film was a relative disappointment.I will not knock the artwork. This definitely maintains the high standards that elevate all Pixar films with regards to quality of animation. The racing and hi-jinx spy sequences done in familiar landmark locales all over the world were all very excellently rendered. There was action in the roads, underwater and the skies. This time we get to see talking boats and planes, aside from just the titular cars. For me the problem was with the story. I think the complex spy story that underlies this installment, and the highfalutin spy lingo it uses, flies over the comprehension of the young kiddie audience it caters to. I do not think kids would fully understand about the issues on alternative fuels or on "lemon" cars. These "adult" issues that motivate the villains' violent actions will make it hard for kids to really get the story without parental explanation. I think it was not too cool to see cars being "killed" in some very violent scenes. I do not think it was a good idea to kids to see their gentle favorite Mater with rocket boosters and machine guns.Contrary to most expectations, Lightning McQueen is NOT the hero of Cars 2. The central character in this one is Mater, whom we knew as the loyal sidekick. Unfortunately, for me at least, Mater did not cut it as leading man. His awkward country bumpkin demeanor and hick-town country drawl were only funny from the side, but was rather hard to take when it was front and center most of the time. After Mater, the cars with more screen time than McQueen were British spy cars Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell. While they were both quintessentially cool British secret agents, they also blow the beloved "heart and soul" of the first Cars movie out of this film's focus. You hardly even see Sally and the rest of the Radiator Springs gang. It was also that the focus of the whole film was more the "James Bond"-like spy story, while the races were merely incidental.

car2 was actually was a good movie. I Don't KNOW WHY THIS got negative reviews . its actually a good family film for both children and adults. the action is great the animation everything. I mean seriously I don't care if mater is the main character nothing is wrong with it. even though it doesn't have emotional moments like the original its still insetting. the songs just feel nice to listen to its sounds nice. Spoiler alert there a part s o well crafted when radiator springs is fighting the lemons . cars the original is great this was twice as good as the original and Is looking forward to see Cars 3

Pixar animation has had a terrific run of films with a high emphasis on quality control. Cars was the one film to have had a decidedly mixed critical response but its international box office led to a sequel with Cars 2.Lightning McQueen and Mater returns as they travel internationally to race in the World Grand Prix. To keep the international audience satisfied the action moves to Japan, London, Paris.However Mater gets caught up in some kind of conspiracy as British spy Finn McMissile infiltrates some untapped oil reserves owned by a group of 'lemon' cars. After being discovered, he is forced to flee and fake his death but mistakes Mater as an American spy who is roped into foiling the plot.Owen Wilson returns once again as Lightning McQueen with his cool, laid back tones but the focus shifts in the sequel to Mater voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. However Mater is a country bumpkin and there is little room for character development. The plot is rather easy to guess, its fun, chugs along easily enough but not up to the usual Pixar standards.
---------
The best of Pixar's films have protagonists who are a small part of a very large world and are almost helpless against incredible odds - Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo etc. The protagonists of Cars are very big in a very small world, so do not play to the strengths of Pixar.However, being Pixar, they still make these films better than anyone else would have with the same material. Cars and Cars 2 are intelligently written and filled with more detail than you could comfortably fit into a single screening.This movie is not so much a sequel to the first as an affectionate James Bond parody that happens to be set in the Cars universe. Whereas the original Cars was thematically slow and patient, this one deliberately takes things in the exact opposite direction. Whether anyone will prefer the first film or the second is entirely their preference, and it is wrong to say that one is better than the other. Each film has its own appeals and drawbacks.The main weakness of this film is a failure to create any kind of sympathy for the characters. They are not alone, they are not lost, they have friends and allies and the resources to get out of any situation. It never feels like there is any real danger, as there is with the Toy Story films. Whereas the first film had enough focus on character development to compensate for this, the subplot about the tested friendship between McQueen and Mater seems especially insubstantial here.Nevertheless, I feel like this is an enjoyable installment in the franchise, never letting your attention wander and always ready with a clever idea. They have demonstrated that they are willing to go in entirely new directions with this world - maybe if they make a third film, they can make something truly worthy of the Pixar name?If I were rating this in comparison to other Pixar films, my score would be lower... but scoring this as a film on its own, I think it is deserving of between five and seven stars.

The "Cars" franchise was one of the great successes that Pixar masterfully capitalized on, both for commercial purposes and to cement its top status in the field of digital animation. I remember that these three films were accompanied by such incisive (not to say abusive) merchandising that it seemed that the films were being foisted on us. That explains why I preferred not to see them at the time.If the first film seemed quite regular to me (very good from a technical point of view, but with flaws in the script), this sequel managed to at least maintain the technical level and visual quality. The film has excellent cinematography and graphic work, as is the hallmark of the studio. Realism is excellent, although I felt that it is not as impactful and grandiose as in the first film in the franchise. I also felt that the car races, which were the strong suit of the first film due to their emotion and speed, lost much of their emotion here and sounded much more monotonous. The voice actors continue to do a very good job. Owen Wilson and Larry The Cable Guy secure the most notable efforts, but are closely followed by Michael Caine (with an unmistakable voice), Emily Mortimer and John Turturro.Where this film really failed was in the conception of the script and the story. I understand the reason why they decided to make Mater the main character: both Disney and Pixar have done this recurrently whenever a secondary character appears in the films that seem to stand out. And as in other cases, the result of the decision was extremely disappointing. Mater is not funny, more ridiculous than funny, and McQueen, who is in the shadows this time, is just another pretentious, obnoxious, arrogant driver. Dialogues don't always work well, and some jokes don't either, although most do. I also have certain reservations about the division of the film's action into two subplots (Mater's and the rivalry between McQueen and Francesco), I believe that this made the film much more adult than would be desirable.

Cars 2 wasn't the worst thing I'd ever seen, but on the other hand, it was nowhere NEAR as good as the original.It was a cute movie with some pretty funny scenes, but it didn't have a memorable story, or anything really to let you love it.I barely even watch it, in fact. If I am bored, it's a cute movie to watch, but it's not very intriguing.It's more of a comedy, honestly.The first one to me, meant finding yourself, who you truly are, and taking time to settle down. It was memorable, it was beautiful, and it had funny jokes.This one is just a silly movie hiring a country boy as a spy to defeat a guy who is called a lemon.Not much to this one as the first one, but honestly, if you want a action spy movie with a not-very exciting plot, you can watch this.

'CARS 2': Two Stars (Out of Five) Pixar Studio's 12th animated feature, and without a doubt it's all time low point, is this sequel to the 2006 hit original. Another tale of the adventures of Lightning McQueen and buddy Mater in a world of all living cars and other automobiles. John Lasseter (who also directed the original and first two 'TOY STORY' films) returned to direct the film (his first time doing so since the film's predecessor five years ago) with newcomer Brad Lewis. It was written by Lasseter, Lewis, Dan Fogelman and Ben Queen. The film is only the third sequel Pixar has released (after the second and third 'TOY STORY' films) but many more are planned. This is not a good sign by the looks of 'CARS 2'. Hopefully this was just a speed bump but it was not a good film by any means and by no measure lived up to the previous standards set by the respectable studio.The film picks up with race car Lightning McQueen (once again voiced by Owen Wilson) returning home to his hometown of Radiator Springs after a successful racing trip. His best friend, the tow truck named Mater (once again voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), is overjoyed to see him. After spending a day together catching up Mater quickly becomes jealous when McQueen wants to spend time with his girlfriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt reprising her role) alone. He then gets heated up when he hears a cocky Grand Prix race car named Francesco (John Tuturro) boasting how he could easily take McQueen in any race, on TV. Mater calls up the news show and challenges the race car which leads to McQueen entering the Grand Prix and taking Mater along with him. Once there Mater becomes involved in an espionage adventure (through a classic movie mistaken identity scenario) and teams up with two spies (voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer).The film does have a positive message about friendship and being true to yourself regardless of how others treat you because of it, as well as an environmental message about alternative fuel sources, but it seems tacked on and forced. The rest of the movie is a pain to get through to get to it and not quality entertainment for anyone (of any age). I was extremely bored and annoyed by the film and I could tell most others in the theater I was seeing it in were as well. Kids were crying and being antsy and parents were moaning and constantly yawning. The film barely got any laughs or signs of positive emotion from anyone in the theater that I could tell. The magic just wasn't there like with other Pixar films. The movie is loud, clanky and simply put a mess. The characters are underwritten and the story barely holds together for it's nearly two hour running time. Nothing about the film works. It feels like a bad Saturday morning hangover. All except for the visuals, the visuals are still grade A but for the money spent on the film ($200 million) they should be a lot better. Pixar definitely has run low on gas, at least for the time being. Hopefully it can get a jump start.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHRJKrR2Lk

We went to see Cars 2 with my boys who are 6 years old. We all loved the first movie, it had a simple to follow, heart-warming story and NO VIOLENCE!!!This movie had TONS of violence, guns, "dead" cars, cars getting bashed, burned, tortured. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!?!? Just because it was cars and not people did you think the kids wouldn't notice? It was a very hard to follow story for them. A full-on James Bond movie, with twists and gadgets, except in animation and with cars instead of humans.My twins could not repeat the story back to us when asked afterward. Espionage, oil wars and the likes were lost on the younger audience. The violence was full-on. Even Mater, the plain, redneck, lovable character was fitted with machine guns!! In fact the movie was more a Mater movie than a Lightning McQueen movie. We see McQueen in very few scenes compared. It more like a full feature Mater Tale than a sequel to the movie... plus it wasn't about racing at all but rather about oil wars.Very disappointing. My husband made a good point, he said it was as if it was aimed to the 8 year old who watched the original 5 years ago and are now 13 years old. Certainly NOT aimed at young kids. If your kids are very young and you do not approve of violence, beatings, killings and guns DO NOT TAKE THEM. I wish someone had warned us, we wouldn't have gone. I can't fathom what Pixar was thinking! I am now dreading Monsters INC 2... it will most certainly be ... I don't know... full of blood and guts? That seems to be their next step...

Spies Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) and Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) are trying to contact an American spy to help stop an evil plot. The problem, Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) was mistaken as the American spy. Meanwhile Mater had accepted a challenge on behave of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). Although Lighting McQueen's friendship with Mater is sorely tested as Mater keeps embarrassing himself in front of the competition.The franchise is continued with this sequel. This time they added a 007 storyline. But the main storyline continues to be the friendship of Lightning McQueen and Mater. The 007 storyline gives it something different and interesting. There is some fun, but it's not as poignant as the original. It comes off as more silly especially because with an evil plot.
