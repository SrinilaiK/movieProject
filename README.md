# movieProject

Dependencies to install:
 - pip install cinemagoer
 - pip install mysql-connector-python

Initial version: Webscraper used to take in input from a user and the script will return the general sentiment of the movie selected.

Next Steps:
 - Figure out how to store the data in dataset.  
 - Dataset should store at most of 100 Reviews of top 50 movies of the year (refresh every x amount of months)  
 - Choose a model for sentiment analysis, see what the model requires, clean data based on that (Special Characters, review length, etc)  
 - Maybe fine tune model specifically for movie reviews if not already one existing  
 - Determine what we want it to output, how we come up with quantitative metric  
 - Build Frontend, content to backend
